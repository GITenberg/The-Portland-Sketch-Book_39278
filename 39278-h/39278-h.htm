<div class="transnote"><h3>Transcriber's Note:</h3>

<p>In "Descriptions of the Divine Being," P. 96, the block quote inside ~
(tilde) marks is a transliteration of the Hebrew. The transliteration
was not present in the original and has been added by the transcriber;
[h.] is used for Het, to distinguish it from h for Hey. The UTF8 and
HTML versions also have the Hebrew script shown in the original.</p>

<p>Remaining transcriber's notes are at the end of the text.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The object of the Portland Sketch-Book, is to collect
in a small compass, literary specimens from such authors
as have a just claim to be styled Portland writers.
The list might have been extended to a much
greater length, had all been included who have made
our city a place of transient residence; but no writer
has a place in this volume who is not, or has not been,
a citizen of Portland, either by birth or a long residence.
Therefore, all the names contained in these
pages are emphatically those of Portland authors.
Among those who were actually born here and either
wholly, or in part educated here, will be found the following
names, most of which are already known to the
world of literature.</p>

<p>S. B. Beckett&mdash;James Brooks&mdash;William Cutter&mdash;Charles
S. Daveis&mdash;Nathaniel Deering&mdash;P. H. Greenleaf&mdash;Charles
P. Ilsley&mdash;Joseph Ingraham&mdash;Geo. W.
Light&mdash;Henry W. Longfellow&mdash;Grenville Mellen&mdash;Frederick
Mellen&mdash;Isaac McLellan, Jr.&mdash;John Neal&mdash;Elizabeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>Smith&mdash;William Willis&mdash;N. P. Willis.</p>

<p>Considering the population of our city&mdash;hardly fifteen
thousand at this time&mdash;the list itself we apprehend will
be considered as not the least remarkable part of the
book.</p>

<p>It was the design of the Publishers to furnish a book
composed of original articles from all our living authors,
and to select only from those who have been lost
to us; but though great exertions were made, the editor
found much difficulty in collecting original materials,
even after they had been promised by almost every
individual to whom she applied. According to the
original design, each living author was to have contributed
a limited number of pages; but after frequent disappointments,
all restrictions were taken off; each
writer furnished as many original pages as suited his
pleasure, and the deficiency was supplied by selected
articles. In her selections, the editor has endeavored
to do impartial justice to our authors, and, in almost
every instance, she has been guided by them in her
choice. If in any case she has been obliged to exercise
her own judgment, in contradiction to theirs, it
was because the publishers had restricted her to a certain
number of pages, and the articles proposed would
have swelled the volume beyond the prescribed limits.
<i>Original</i> papers are inserted exactly as they were
supplied by their separate authors. A general invitation
was extended; therefore it should give no offence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>if those who have contributed largely fill the greater
portion of the Book, to the exclusion of much excellent
matter, which might have been selected. Several
writers who did not forward their contributions as expected,
have been omitted altogether, as the editor
could find nothing of theirs extant which was adapted
to a work strictly literary.</p>

<p>In order to avoid all appearance of partiality, it has
been thought advisable to make an alphabetical arrangement
of names, and to let chance decide the position
of each author in the Book.</p>

<p>The compiler has a word of apology to offer, before
she consigns her little book to the public. Reasons
which will be easily understood would have prevented
her appropriating any considerable portion to herself;
but she had contracted with the publishers to furnish a
volume, which should be at least two thirds original,
and when the pages forwarded to her were found insufficient
for her object, she was obliged, however unwillingly,
to supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>The Editor now submits her Portland Book to the
public, with much solicitude that it may meet with
approbation&mdash;feeling
certain that indulgence would be
extended to her, could it be known how much labor
and difficulty have attended her slender exertions, in
the literature of a city she has never ceased to love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>P. S. Among the papers omitted from necessity, is
one by the Rev. Dr. Nichols, which, owing to accident,
did not arrive till the arrangements for the work were
entirely completed. In the absence of the Editor,
whose own leading article arrived <i>almost</i> too late for
insertion, we have taken the liberty to state the facts,
that our readers may understand the cause of an omission
so extraordinary.</p>

<span class="i0">A beauteous Cove, amid the isles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sprinkle Casco's winding bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, like an Eden, nature smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all her wild and rich array.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis sheltered from the ocean's roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By beetling crags and foam-girt rifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mossy trees, that ages hoar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have braved the sea-gales on its cliffs!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broad-armed oak, the beech and pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And elm, their branches intertwine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above its tranquil, glassy face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that the sun finds scarcely space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At mid-day, for his fervid beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shimmer on the limpid stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in its rugged, sparry caves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn by the winter's tempest waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleams many a crystal wildly bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like <i>diamonds</i>, flashing radiant light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hence the fairy spot is 'hight.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The forests far extending round,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor is man's toil or traces there;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">As desert isles in Indian seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sometimes rise upon the view<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sleeping alone mid ocean's blue.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The lonely ospray rears her brood<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And through the long, bright summer day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ocean, calm as mountain lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears not a breath its hush to break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The snow-winged sea-gull tilts away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the long, smooth swell, that sweeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In curving, wide, unbroken reach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the cove from outer deeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwinding up the pebbly beach.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Oft blithly ring the wide old woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within their loneliest solitudes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To youthful shout, and song, and glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And viol's merry minstrelsy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When summer's stirless, sultry air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pervades the city's thoroughfare,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The dance goes round; the trunks so tall&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of nature's greenest, loveliest woof!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maiden weaves, in lieu of wreath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bending fern-plumes in her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wild flowers with scented breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That spring to blossom every where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around; the forest's dream-like rest<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On the blue waste, the fisher's skiff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes dancing in, and 'neath the cliff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is moored to rest, till morning's train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beams with fresh beauty o'er the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wakes him to his toil again!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When slope, and rock, and wood around,<br /></span>

<h2><a name="OUR_OWN_COUNTRY" id="OUR_OWN_COUNTRY"></a>OUR OWN COUNTRY.</h2>

<h3>By James Brooks.</h3>


<p>What nation presents such a spectacle as ours, of a
confederated government, so complicated, so full of
checks and balances, over such a vast extent of territory,
with so many varied interests, and yet moving so
harmoniously! I go within the walls of the capitol at
Washington, and there, under the star-spangled banners
that wave amid its domes, I find the representatives of
three territories, and of twenty-four nations, nations in
many senses they may be called, that have within them
all the germ and sinew to raise a greater people than
many of the proud principalities of Europe, all speaking
one language&mdash;all acting with one heart, and all
burning with the same enthusiasm&mdash;the love and glory
of our common country,&mdash;even if parties do exist, and
bitter domestic quarrels now and then arise. I take my
map, and I mark from whence they come. What a
breadth of latitude, and of longitude, too,&mdash;in the fairest
portion of North-America! What a variety of climate,&mdash;and
then what a variety of production! What
a stretch of sea-coast, on two oceans&mdash;with harbors
enough for all the commerce of the world! What an
immense national domain, surveyed, and unsurveyed,
of extinguished, and unextinguished Indian titles within
the States and Territories, and without, estimated, in
the aggregate, to be 1,090,871,753 acres, and to be
worth the immense sum of <ins title="Transcriber's Note:
alternatively '1,363,589,69 dollars,--' see full note at end">$1,363,589,69,&mdash;</ins>750,000,000
acres of which are without the bounds of the States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and the territories, and are yet to make new States
and to be admitted into the Union! Our annual revenue,
now, from the sales, is over three millions of dollars.
Our national debt, too, is already more than extinguished,&mdash;and
yet within fifty-eight years, starting with
a population of about three millions, we have fought
the War of Independence, again not ingloriously struggled
with the greatest naval power in the world, fresh
with laurels won on sea and land,&mdash;and now we have
a population of over thirteen millions of souls. One
cannot feel the grandeur of our Republic, unless he
surveys it in detail. For example, a Senator in Congress,
from Louisiana, has just arrived in Washington.
Twenty days of his journey he passed in a steam-boat
on inland waters,&mdash;moving not so rapidly, perhaps, as
other steam-boats sometimes move, in deeper waters,&mdash;but
constantly moving, at a quick pace too, day and
night. I never shall forget the rapture of a traveller,
who left the green parks of New Orleans early in
March,&mdash;that land of the orange and the olive, then
teeming with verdure, freshness and life, and, as it
were, mocking him with the mid-summer of his own
northern home. He journeyed leisurely toward the
region of ice and snow, to watch the budding of the
young flowers, and to catch the breeze of the Spring.
He crossed the Lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne; he
ascended the big Tombeckbee in a comfortable steam-boat.
From Tuscaloosa, he shot athwart the wilds of
Alabama, over Indian grounds, that bloody battles have
rendered ever memorable. He traversed Georgia, the
Carolinas, ranged along the base of the mountains of
Virginia,&mdash;and for three months and more, he enjoyed
one perpetual, one unvarying, ever-coming Spring,&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
most delicious season of the year,&mdash;till, by the
middle of June, he found himself in the fogs of the
Passamaquoddy, where tardy summer was even then
hesitating whether it was time to come. And yet he
had not been off the soil of his own country! The flag
that he saw on the summit of the fortress, on the lakes
near New Orleans, was the like of that which floated
from the staff on the hills of Fort Sullivan, in the easternmost
extremity of Maine;&mdash;and the morning gun
that startled his slumbers, among the rocky battlements
that defy the wild tides of the Bay of Fundy, was not
answered till many minutes after, on the shores of the
Gulf of Mexico. The swamps, the embankments, the
cane-brakes of the Father of Waters, on whose muddy
banks the croaking alligator displayed his ponderous
jaws,&mdash;the cotton-fields, the rice-grounds of the low
southern country,&mdash;and the vast fields of wheat and
corn in the regions of the mountains, were far, far behind
him:&mdash;and he was now, in a Hyperborean land&mdash;where
nature wore a rough and surly aspect, and a
cold soil and a cold clime, drove man to launch his
bark upon the ocean, to dare wind and wave, and to
seek from the deep, in fisheries, and from freights, the
treasures his own home will not give him. Indeed,
such a journey as this, in one's own country, to an inquisitive
mind, is worth all 'the tours of Europe.' If
a young American, then, wishes to feel the full importance
of an American Congress, let him make such a
journey. Let him stand on the levee at New Orleans
and count the number and the tiers of American vessels
that there lie, four, five and six thick, on its long embankment.
Let him hear the puff, puff, puff, of the
high-pressure steam-boats, that come sweeping in almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
every hour, perhaps from a port two thousand miles
off,&mdash;from the then frozen winter of the North, to the
full burning summer of the South,&mdash;all inland navigation,&mdash;fleets
of them under his eye,&mdash;splendid boats,
too, many of them, as the world can show,&mdash;with elegant
rooms, neat berths, spacious saloons, and a costly
piano, it may be,&mdash;so that travellers of both sexes can
dance or sing their way to Louisville, as if they were on
a party of pleasure. Let him survey all these, as they
come in with products from the Red River, twelve
hundred miles in one direction, or from Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania, two thousand miles in another direction,
from the western tributaries of the vast Mississippi, the
thickets of the Arkansas, or White River,&mdash;from the
muddy, far-reaching Missouri, and its hundreds of
branches:&mdash;and then in the east, from the Illinois, the
Ohio, and its numerous tributaries&mdash;such as the Tennessee,
the Cumberland, or the meanest of which, such
as the Sandy River, on the borders of Kentucky&mdash;that
will in a freshet fret and roar, and dash, as if it were
the Father of Floods, till it sinks into nothing, when
embosomed in the greater stream, and there acknowledges
its own insignificance. Let him see 'the Broad
Horns,' the adventurous flatboats of western waters, on
which&mdash;frail bark!&mdash;the daring backwoodsman sallies
forth from the Wabash, or rivers hundreds of miles
above, on a voyage of atlantic distance, with hogs&mdash;horses&mdash;oxen
and cattle of all kinds on board&mdash;corn,
flour, wheat, all the products of rich western lands&mdash;and
let him see them, too, as he stems the strong current
of the Mississippi, as if the wood on which he floated
was realizing the fable of the Nymphs of Ida&mdash;goddesses,
instead of pines. Take the young traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
where the clear, silvery waters of the Ohio become
tinged with the mud from the Missouri, and where the
currents of the mighty rivers run apart for miles, as if
indignant at the strange embrace. Ascend with him
farther, to St. Louis, where, if he looks upon the map
he will find that he is about as near the east as the west,
and that soon, the emigrant, who is borne on the wave
of population that now beats at the base of the Rocky
Mountains, and anon will overleap its summits&mdash;will
speak of him as he now speaks of New-England, as far
in the east. And then tell him that far west as he is,
he is but at the beginning of steam navigation&mdash;that the
Mississippi itself is navigable six or seven hundred
miles upward&mdash;and that steam-boats have actually gone
on the Missouri two thousand one hundred miles above
its mouth, and that they <i>can go</i> five hundred miles farther
still! Take him, then, from this land where the
woodsman is leveling the forest every hour, across
the rich prairies of Illinois, where civilization is throwing
up towns and villages, pointed with the spire of the
church, and adorned with the college and the school,&mdash;then
athwart the flourishing fields of Indiana, to Cincinnati,&mdash;well
called 'the Queen of the West,'&mdash;a city of
thirty thousand inhabitants, with paved streets, numerous
churches, flourishing manufactories, and an intelligent
society too,&mdash;and this in a State with a million
of souls in it now, that has undertaken gigantic public
works,&mdash;where the fierce savages, even within the
memory of the young men, made the hearts of their
parents quake with fear,&mdash;roaming over the forests, as
they did, in unbridled triumph,&mdash;wielding the tomahawk
in terror, and ringing the war-hoop like demons of vengeance
let loose from below! Show him our immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
inland seas, from Green Bay to Lake Ontario,&mdash;not
inconsiderable oceans,&mdash;encompassed with fertile fields.
Show him the public works of the Empire State, as
well as those of Pennsylvania,&mdash;works the wonder of
the world,&mdash;such as no people in modern times have
ever equalled. And then introduce him to the busy,
humming, thriving population of New-England, from
the Green Mountains of Vermont, the Switzerland of
America, to the northern lakes and wide sea-coast of
Maine. Show him the industry, energy, skill and ingenuity
of these hardy people, who let not a rivulet
run, nor a puff of wind blow, without turning it to some
account,&mdash;who mingle in every thing, speculate in
every thing, and dare every thing wherever a cent of
money is to be earned&mdash;whose lumbermen are found
not only in the deepest woods of the snowy and fearful
wilds of Maine, throwing up sawmills on the lone waterfalls,
and making the woods ring with their hissing
music&mdash;but found, too, on the banks of the St. Lawrence,
and coming also on mighty rafts of deal from
every eastern tributary of the wild St. John, Meduxnekeag
and Aroostook, streams whose names geographers
hardly know. And then too, as if this were not enough,
they turn their enterprize and form companies 'to log
and lumber,' even on the Ocmulgee and Oconee of the
State of Georgia&mdash;and on this day they are actually
found in the Floridas, there planning similar schemes,
and as there are no waterfalls, making steam impel
their saws. Show him the banks of the Penobscot,
now studded with superb villages&mdash;jewels of places,
that have sprung up like magic&mdash;the magnificent military
road that leads to the United States' garrison at
Houlton, a fairy spot in the wilderness, but approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
by as excellent a road as the United States can
boast of.</p>

<p>Show him the hundreds and hundreds of coasters that
run up every creek and inlet of tide-water there, at
times left high and dry, as if the ocean would never
float them more: and then lift him above considerations
of a mercenary character, and show him how
New-England men are perpetuating their high character
and holy love of liberty,&mdash;and how, by neat and
elegant churches, that adorn every village,&mdash;by comfortable
school-houses, that appear every two miles, or
oftener, upon almost every road, free for every body,&mdash;high-born,
and low-born,&mdash;by academies and colleges,
that thicken even to an inconvenience; by asylums
and institutions, munificently endowed, for the benefit
of the poor:&mdash;and see, too, with what generous pride
their bosoms swell when they go within the consecrated
walls of Faneuil Hall, or point out the heights of Bunker
Hill, or speak of Concord, or Lexington.</p>

<p>Give any young man such a tour as this&mdash;the best
he can make&mdash;and I am sure his heart will beat quick,
when he sees the proud spectacle of the assemblage of
the representatives of all these people, and all these
interests, within a single hall. He will more and more
revere the residue of those revolutionary patriots, who
not only left us such a heritage, won by their sufferings
and their blood, but such a constitution&mdash;such a government
here in Washington, regulating all our national
concerns&mdash;but who have also, in effect, left us twenty-four
other governments, with territory enough to double
them by-and-by&mdash;that regulate all the minor concerns
of the people, acting within their own sphere; now, in
the winter, assembling within their various capitols, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Jefferson city, on Missouri, to Augusta, on the Kennebec;&mdash;from
the capitol on the Hudson, to the government
house on the Mississippi. Show me a spectacle
more glorious, more encouraging, than this, even in
the pages of all history; such a constellation of free
States, with no public force, but public opinion&mdash;moving
by well regulated law&mdash;each in its own proper orbit,
around the brighter star in Washington,&mdash;thus realizing,
as it were, on earth, almost practically, the beautiful
display of infinite wisdom, that fixed the sun in the
centre, and sent the revolving planets on their errands.
God grant it may end as with them!</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CRUISE_OF_THE_DART" id="THE_CRUISE_OF_THE_DART"></a>THE CRUISE OF THE DART.</h2>

<h3>By S. B. Beckett.</h3>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There was an old and quiet man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And by the fire sat he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, said he, to you I'll tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things passing strange that once befell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A ship upon the sea."&mdash;<i>Mary Howitt.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>"There she is, Ricardo," said I to my friend, as we
reached the end of the pier, in Havana, while the Dart
lay about half a mile off the shore,&mdash;"what think you
of her?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful!&mdash;a more symmetrical craft never passed
the Moro!"</p>

<p>So thought I, and my heart responded with a thrill
of pride to the sentiment. How saucy she looked,
with her gay streamers abroad upon the winds, and the
red-striped flag of the Union floating jauntily at the
main peak&mdash;with her lofty masts tapering away, till,
relieved against the blue abyss, they were apparently
diminished to the size of willow wands, while the slight
ropes that supported the upper spars seemed, from the
pier, like the fairy tracery of the spider. Although surrounded
by ships, xebecs, brigantines, polacres, galleys
and galliots from almost every clime in christendom,
she stood up conspicuously among them all, an
apt representative of the land whence she came! But
let us take a nearer view of the beauty. The hull was
long, low, and at the bows almost as sharp as the missile
after which she was named. From the waist to
the stern she tapered away in the most graceful proportions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and she had as lovely a run as ever slid over
the dancing billows. Light and graceful as a sea-bird,
she rocked on the undulating water. But her rig!&mdash;herein,
to my thinking, was her chiefest beauty&mdash;every
thing pertaining to it was so exact, so even and so
<i>tanto</i>. Besides the sail usually carried by man-of-war
schooners, she had the requisite appertenances for a
royal and flying kite, or sky-sail, which, now that she
was in port, were all rigged up. Not another vessel of
her class in the navy could spread so much canvas to
the influence of old Boreas as the Dart.</p>

<p>Her armament consisted of one long brass twenty-four
pounder, mounted on a revolving carriage midships,
and six twelve-pound carronades. Add to this
a picked crew of ninety men, with the redoubtable
Jonathan West as our captain, Mr. Dacre Dacres as first,
and your humble servant, Ahasuerus Hackinsack, as
second lieutenant, besides a posse of minor officers
and middies,&mdash;and you may form a faint idea of the
Dart.</p>

<p>Bidding adieu to my friend, I jumped into the pinnace
waiting, and in a few minutes stood on her quarter
deck.</p>

<p>But it will be necessary for me to explain for what
purpose the Dart was here. She had been dispatched
by government to cruise among the Leeward Islands,
and about Cape St. Antonio, in quest of a daring band
of pirates, who, trusting to their superior prowess and
the fleetness of their vessel, a schooner called the Sea-Sprite,
had long scourged the merchantmen of the Indian
seas with impunity. Cruiser after cruiser had
been sent out to attack them in vain. She had invariably
escaped, until at length, in reality, they were left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
for awhile, the undisputed 'rulers of the waves,' as
they vauntingly styled themselves. It was said of the
Sea-Sprite, that she was as fleet as the winds, and as
mysterious in her movements; and her master spirit,
the fierce Juan Piesta, was as wily and fierce a robber,
as ever prowled upon the western waters. Indeed,
so wonderful and various had been his escapes, that
many of the Spaniards, and the lower orders of seamen
in general, believed him to be leagued with the Powers
of Darkness!</p>

<p>But the Dart had been fitted up for the present
cruise expressly on account of her matchless speed,
and our captain, generally known in the service by the
significant appellation of Old Satan West, was, in situations
where fighting or peril formed any part of the
story, a full match for his namesake.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>After cruising about the western extremity of Cuba,
for nearly a month, to no purpose, we bore away for
the southern coast of St. Domingo, and at the time my
story opens, were off Jacquemel. The morning was
heralded onward by troops of clouds, of the most
brilliant and burning hues&mdash;deep crimson ridges&mdash;fire-fringed
volumes of purple, hanging far in the depths of
the mild and beautiful heaven&mdash;long, rose-tinted and
golden plumes, stretching up from the horizon to the
zenith,&mdash;forming altogether a most gorgeous and magnificent
spectacle, while, to complete the pageant, the
sun, just rising from his ocean lair, shed a flood of
glaring light far over the restless expanse toward us,
and every rope and spar of our vessel, begemmed with
bright dew-drops, flashed and twinkled in his beams,
like the jeweled robes of a princely bride.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fore top there! what's that away in the wake o'
the sun?" called out Mr. Dacres.</p>

<p>"A drifting spar, I believe, Sir&mdash;but the sun throws
such a glare on the water I cannot see plainly."</p>

<p>I looked in the direction pointed out, and saw a
dark object tumbling about on the fiery swell, like an
evil spirit in torment. We altered our course and stood
away toward it. It turned out to be a boat, apparently
empty, but on a nearer inspection we perceived a man
lying under its thwarts, whose pale, lank features and
sunken eye bespoke him as suffering the last pangs of
starvation. My surprise can better be imagined than
described, on discovering in the unfortunate man a
highly loved companion of my boyhood, Frederick
Percy! He was transferred from his miserable quarters
to a snug berth on board of the Dart, and in a few
hours, by the judicious management of our surgeon,
was resuscitated, so as to be able to come on deck.</p>

<p>His story may be told in a few words. He had been
travelling in England&mdash;while there had married a beautiful,
but friendless orphan. Soon after this occurrence
he embarked in one of his father's ships for Philadelphia,
intending to touch at St. Domingo city, and take
in a freight. But, three days before, when within a
few hours' sail of their destined port, they had fallen in
with a piratical schooner, which, after a short struggle,
succeeded in capturing them. While protecting his
wife from the insults of the bucaneers, he received a
blow in the temple, which deprived him of his senses;
and when he awoke to consciousness it was night, wild
and dark, and he was tossing on the lone sea, without
provisions, sail or oars, as we had found him. For three
days he had not tasted food. Poor fellow! his anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
as to the fate of his wife almost drove him to distraction.</p>

<p>This circumstance assured us that we were on the
right trail of the marauder whom we sought. We continued
beating up the coast till noon, when the breeze
died away into a stark calm, and we lay rolling on the
long glassy swell, about ten leagues from the St. Domingo
shore. The sun was intensely powerful, glowing
through the hazy atmosphere, directly over our
heads, like a red-hot cannon ball; and the far-stretching
main was as sultry and <i>arid</i> as the sands of an
African desert. To the north, the cloud-topped mountains
of St. Domingo obstructed our view, looming
through the blue haze to an immense height&mdash;presenting
to as the aspect of huge, flat, shadowy walls; and
one need have taxed his imagination but lightly, to
fancy them the boundaries dividing us from a brighter
and a better clime. The depths of the ocean were
as translucent as an unobscured summer sky, and far
beneath us we could distinguish the dolphins and king-fish,
roaming leisurely about, or darting hither and thither
as some object attracted their pursuit; while nearer
its surface the blue element was alive with myriads
of minor nondescripts, riggling, flouncing and lazily
moving up and down,&mdash;probably attracted by the shade
of our dark hull.</p>

<p>The men having little else to do, obtained from the
captain permission to fish. Directly they had hauled
in a dozen or more of the most ill-favored, shapeless,
unchristian-looking articles I ever clapped eyes on,
which, when I came from aft, were dancing their
death jigs on the forecastle-deck, much to the diversion
of the captain's black waiter, Essequibo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Halloo!&mdash;this way, blackey!" shouted an old tar
to the merry African, who, by the way, was a kind of
reference table for the whole crew&mdash;"Egad! Billy,
look here,&mdash;what do you call this comical looking
devil that has helped himself to my hook? Why! his
body is as long as the articles of discipline, and his
mouth almost as long as his body!&mdash;your own main-hatch-way
is not a circumstance to it!"</p>

<p>"Him be one gar fish&mdash;ocium gar!&mdash;he no good
for eat," answered the black with a grin that drew the
corners of his mouth almost back to his ears, so that,
to appearance, small was the hinge that kept brain and
body together.</p>

<p>At the sight the querist dropped the fish, exclaiming
with feigned wonder, "By all that's crooked, an even
bet!&mdash;ar'n't your mouth made ov injy rubber, Billy!"</p>

<p>"Good ting to hab de larsh mout, Misser Mongo,&mdash;eat
de more&mdash;lib de longer," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Screw your blinkers this way, Jack Simpson, there's
a prize for you," said another, as he dragged a huge
lump-headed, bull-eyed, tail-less mass out of the water,
with fins protruding, like thorns, from every part of his
body!&mdash;"Guess he's one of the fighting cocks down
below, seeing his spurs!&mdash;any how, he's well armed,&mdash;I'll
be keel-hauled, if he don't look like the beauty that
we saw carved out on the Frencher's stern, with the
Neptune bestride it, in Havana, barin' he wants a tail!
Han't he a queer un?&mdash;but how in natur do you suppose
he makes out to steer without a rudder?"</p>

<p>"Steer wid he head turn behin' him!" answered
Seignor Essequibo, bursting into a chuckling laugh&mdash;mightily
tickled with the struggles of the ungainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
monster,&mdash;"Che, che, che!&mdash;him sea-dragum&mdash;catch
um plenty on de cos ob Barbado. Take care ob him
horn!"</p>

<p>"Yo, heave, ho! Shaint Pathrick, an' it's me what's
caught a whale!" drawled out a brawny Patlander,
while he tugged and sweated to heave in his prize.</p>

<p>"My gorra! you hook one barracouter!" cried
Billy, as his eye caught a glimpse of the big fish curveting
in the water at the end of Paddy's line,&mdash;"Bes'
fish in de worl'!&mdash;good for make um chowder&mdash;good
for fry&mdash;for ebery ting,&mdash;me help you pull him in,
Massa Coulan," and without further ado, he laid hold
of the line. The beautiful fish was hauled in, and
consigned to the custody of the cook.</p>

<p>"Stave in my bulwarks, if this 'ere dragon-fish ha'n't
stuck one of his horns into my foot an inch deep!"
roared an old marine,&mdash;"Hand me that sarving mallet,
snow ball, I'll see if I can't give him a hint to
behave better!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah!&mdash;here comes an owl-fish, I reckon;"
shouted a merry wight of a tar, from the land of wooden
nutmegs,&mdash;"specimen of the salt-water owl! Lord,
look at his teeth&mdash;how he grins!&mdash;What are you
laughing at, my beauty?"</p>

<p>"Le diable! une chouette dans la mer?" exclaimed
a little wizen-pated Frenchman, who had seated himself
astraddle of the cathead.&mdash;"Vel, Monsieur Vagastafsh,
comment nommez vous dish petit poisson?"</p>

<p>"Poison! No, Monsheer, I rather guess there han't
the least bit o' poison in natur about that ere <i>young
shark</i>!" replied Wagstaff, "though for that matter
a shark's worse'n poison."</p>

<p>"I not mean poison&mdash;I say poisson&mdash;<i>fish</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, poison fish&mdash;yes, I know&mdash;you'll find plenty of
them on the Bahamy copper banks. I always gets the
cook to put a piece of silver in the boilers, when we
grub on fish in them ere parts."</p>

<p>"O, mon dieu! le rashcalle hash bitez mon vum
almos' off! Sacré, vous ingrat, to treatez me so like,
when I am feed you wis de bon dîner!"</p>

<p>My attention was called away from this scene of
hilarity, by the voice of the watch in the fore-top, announcing
a sail in sight.</p>

<p>A faint indefinable speck could be seen in the quarter
designated, fluttering on the bosom of the blue sea
like a drift of foam. With the aid of the glass we made
it out to be the topsail of a schooner, so distant that her
hull and lower sails were below the brim of the horizon.
Her canvas had probably just been unloosed to the
breeze, which was directly after seen roughening the
face of the broad, smooth expanse as it swept down toward
us.</p>

<p>"That glass, Mr. Waters&mdash;she is standing toward
us, and by the gods of war! the cut of her narrow flying
royal, looks marvellously like that of our friend,
the Sea-Sprite!" said the captain, while the blood
flashed over his bald forehead, like 'heat lightning' over
a summer cloud; "Mr. Hackinsack, see that every
thing is ready for a chase."</p>

<p>The broad sails were unloosed and sheeted close
home. Directly the wind was with us, and we were
bowling along under a press of canvas.</p>

<p>"Now, quartermaster, look to your sails as closely,
as you would watch one seeking your life." Another
squint through the glass. "Ha! they have suspected
us, and are standing in toward the land, jam on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
wind;&mdash;let them look to it sharply; it must be a fleet
pair of heels that can keep pace with the Dart,&mdash;though
to say the least of yonder cruiser, she is no laggard!"</p>

<p>After pacing the deck some ten minutes, he again
hove short and lifted the glass to his eye.</p>

<p>"By heavens! the little witch still holds her way
with us!&mdash;Have the skysail set, and rig out the top-gallant-studd'n'sail!"</p>

<p>Every one on board was now eager in the chase. The
orders were obeyed almost as soon as given. Our
proud vessel, under the press of sail, absolutely flew
over the water, haughtily tossing the rampant surges
from her sides, while her bows were buried in a roaring
and swirling sheet of foam, and a broad band of snow
stretched far over the dark blue waste astern, showing
a wake as strait as an arrow. She was careened down
to the breeze, so that her lower studd'n'sail-boom every
moment dashed a cloud of spray from the romping
billows, and her lee rail was at times under water. Her
masts curved and whiffled beneath the immense piles of
canvas, like a stringed bow.</p>

<p>"She walks the waters bravely," said the captain,
casting a glance of exultation at the distended sails and
bending spars, and then at our arrowy wake.&mdash;"But,
by Jupiter, the chase still almost holds her way with us.
We need more sail aft. Bear a hand, my men, and
run up the ringtail."</p>

<p>"That will answer,&mdash;a dolphin would have a sweat
to beat us in this trim!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr Percy, is yonder dasher the craft that
pillaged your ship, and sent you cruising about the
ocean in that bit of a cockle-shell, think you?"</p>

<p>"That is the pirate schooner&mdash;I cannot mistake her,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
replied Percy, who stood with his flashing eyes rivetted
on the vessel, and his fingers impatiently working about
the hilt of his cutlass, while his brow was darkened
with an intense desire of revenge.</p>

<p>Three hours passed, and we had gained within a
league of the noble looking craft. She was heeled
down to the breeze, so that owing to the 'bagging' of
her lower sails, her hull was almost hidden from sight.
Like a snowy cloud, she darted along the revelling waters,
the sunbeams basking on her wide-spread wings,
and the sprightly billows flashing and surging around
her bows. Never saw I an object more beautiful.</p>

<p>The land was now fully in sight&mdash;a stern and rock-bound
coast, against which the breakers dashed with
maddening violence, and for half a mile from the shore,
the water was one conflicting waste of snowy surf and
billow. No signs of inhabitants, on either hand, as far
as the eye could view, were discernible. The long
range of stern, solitary mountains arose from the waves,
and towered away till lost in the clouds. Their sides,
save where some splintered cliff lifted its gray peaks in
the day, were clothed with thick forests, among which
the tufted palm and wild cinnamon stood up conspicuously,
like sentinels looking afar over the wide waste
of blue. Here and there a torrent could be traced,
leaping from crag to cliff, seeming, as it blazed in the
fierce sun-light, to run liquid fire; and gorgeous masses
of wild creepers and tangled undergrowth hung down
over the embattled heights, swaying and flaunting in
the gale, like the banners and streamers of an encamped
army.</p>

<p>Not the slightest chance for harbor or anchorage
could be discovered along the whole iron-bound coast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
yet the gallant little Sea-sprite held steadily on her
course, steering broad for the base of the mountains.</p>

<p>"Why, in the name of madness, is the fellow driving
in among the breakers?" muttered our captain;&mdash;"Thinks
he to escape by running into danger? By
Mars, and if I mistake not, he shall have peril to his
heart's content, ere nightfall!"</p>

<p>But fate willed that we should be disappointed; for
just as every thing had been arranged to treat the bucaneer
with a fist full of grape and canister, one of those
sudden tempests, so common to the West Indies in the
autumn months, was upon us. A vast, black, conglomerated
volume of vapor swung against the mountain
summits, and curled heavily down over the cliffs. Brilliant
scintillations were darting from its shadowy borders,
and the zigzag lightnings were playing about it, and
licking its ragged folds like the tongues of an evil
spirit! Suddenly it burst asunder, and a burning
gleam&mdash;a wide conflagration, as if the very earth had
exploded&mdash;flashed over the hills, accompanied with a
peal of thunder that made the broad ocean tremble,
and our deck quiver under us, like a harpooned grampus
in his death gasp! The electric fluid upheaved
and hurled to fragments an immense peak near the
summit of the mountains, and huge masses of rock,
with thunderous din, and amid clouds of dust, smoke
and fire, came bounding and racing down from crag to
crag, uprooting the tall cedars, and dashing to splinters
the firm iron-wood trees, as though they had been but
reeds&mdash;sweeping a wide path of ruin through the thick
forests, and shivering to atoms and dust the loose rocks
that obstructed their career, till, with a whirring bound,
they plunged from a beetling cliff into the sea, causing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the tortured water to send up a cloud of mist and spray.
All on board were struck aghast at the blinding brilliancy
of the flash and its terrible effects.</p>

<p>We were aroused to a sense of our situation, by the
clear, sonorous voice of Satan West, whom nothing
pertaining to earth could daunt, calling all hands to
take in sail.</p>

<p>Instantly the trade-wind ceased, and a fearful, death-like
silence ensued. This was of short duration; hardly
were our sails stowed close, when we saw the trees on
shore drawn upwards, twisted off and rent to pieces,
while a dense mass of leaves and broken branches
whirled over the land; and a wild, deep, wailing sound,
as of rushing wings, filled the air, foretelling the onset
of the whirlwind.</p>

<p>"The hurricane is upon us!&mdash;helm hard aweather!"
thundered the captain.</p>

<p>But the Dart was already lying on her beam-ends,
heaving, groaning and quivering throughout every
timber, in the fierce embrace of the tremendous blast!
After its first overpowering shock, however, the gallant
craft slowly recovered, and by dint of the strenuous
exertions of our men, she was got before the gale.
Away she sprang, like a frighted thing, over the tormented
and whitening surges, completely shrouded in
foam and spray. A dense cloud, murky as midnight,
spread over the face of the heavens, where a moment
before, naught met the gazer's eye, save the fleecy
mackerel-clouds, drifting afar through its cerulean halls.
The blue lightnings gleamed, the thunder boomed and
rattled, the black billows shook their flashing manes, the
whole firmament was in an uproar; and amid the wild
rout, our little Dart, as a dry leaf in the autumn winds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
was borne about, a very plaything in the eddying whirls
of the frantic elements.</p>

<p>The tempest was as short lived as it was sudden,
and, as the schooner had sustained no material injury,
directly after it had abated she was under sail again.
When the rain cleared up in shore, every eye sought
eagerly for the pirate craft.</p>

<p>She had vanished!</p>

<p>Nothing met our view but the tossing and tumbling
surges, and the breaker-beaten coast. If ever old Satan
West was taken aback, it was then. His brow
darkened, and a shadow of unutterable disappointment
passed over his countenance.</p>

<p>"Gone!&mdash;By all that is mysterious and wonderful&mdash;gone!"
he muttered to himself,&mdash;"escaped from my
very grasp! Can there be truth in the wild tales told
of her? No, no!&mdash;idiot to harbor the thought for a
moment&mdash;she has foundered!"</p>

<p>But this was hardly probable, as not the slightest
vestige of her remained about the spot.</p>

<p>Poor Percy, too, was the picture of despair. His
hat had been blown away by the hurricane; and his
hair tossed rudely in the wind, as he stood in the main-chains,
gazing with the wildness of a maniac over the
uproarous waters.</p>

<p>"The lovers of the marvelous would here find
enough to fatten upon, I ween," said Dacres, composedly
helping himself to a quid of tobacco. "What think you
is to come next? for I hardly think the play ends with
actors and all being spirited away in a thunder gust!"</p>

<p>I was interrupted in my reply by the energetic exclamations
of the captain, who had been gazing seaward,
over the quarter-rail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, by all the imps in purgatory, it is that devil-leagued
pirate," burst from his lips; and at the same
moment the cry of <i>Sail O!</i> was heard from the forward
watch.</p>

<p>A long-sparred vessel could be seen, relieved against
the black bank of clouds, that were crowding down the
horizon. Surprise was imaged on every countenance,
and when the order was passed to crowd on all sail in
pursuit, a murmur of disapprobation
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'run'">ran</ins> through the
whole crew. However, such was their respect for the
regulations of the service, and so great their dread of
old Satan West, that no one dared demur openly.
Again the Dart was bounding over the waves in pursuit
of the stranger, which had confirmed our suspicions as
to her character, by hoisting all sail and endeavoring to
escape us.</p>

<p>But here likewise we were disappointed. She proved
to be a Baltimore clipper, and had endeavored to
run away from us, taking us for the same craft we had
supposed her to be.</p>

<p>After parting from the Baltimorean, we ran in; and
as the evening fell, anchored under the land, sheltered
from the waves by a little rocky promontory. It was my
turn to take the evening watch. Our wearied crew were
soon lost in sleep, and all was hushed into repose, if I
except the shrill, rasping voices of the green lizards,
the buzzing and humming of the numerous insects on
shore, and the occasional, long-drawn creak, creak of
the cable, as the schooner swung at her anchor. The
evening was mild and beautiful. The moon, attended
by one bright, beautiful planet, was on her wonted
round through the heavens, and the far expanse of
ocean, reflecting her effulgence, seemed to roll in billows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of molten silver beneath the gentle night-wind,
which swept from the land, fragrant with the breath of
wild-flowers and spicy shrubs.</p>

<p>Little Ponto, the royal reefer, lay on a gun carriage
near me. This boy, whom, when on a former cruise,
I had rescued from a Turkish Trader, was a favorite
with all on board. Although, in person, effeminate and
beautiful as a girl, and possessing the strong affections
of the weaker sex, he still was not wanting in that high
courage and energy which constitutes the pride of
manhood. He was an orphan, and with the exception
of a sister and aunt, who were living together in England,
there was not, in the wide world, one being with
whom he could claim relationship. When very young,
he had been entrusted to the charge of the friendly
captain of a merchant ship, bound to Smyrna, for the
purpose of improving his health. But the vessel never
reached her destined port. She was captured by an
Algerine rover, and the boy made prisoner. It was
from the worst of slavery that I had rescued him, and
ever after the occurrence his gratitude toward me knew
no bounds. He appeared to be contented and happy
in his present situation, save when his thoughts reverted
to his lone sister. Then the tears would spring into
his eyes, and he would talk to me of her beauty and
goodness, till I was almost in love with the pure being
which his glowing descriptions had conjured to my
mind. I loved that boy as a brother, and he returned
my affection with a fervor, equalling that of a trusting
woman.</p>

<p>As I leaned against the companion-way, absorbed in
pleasant dreams of my far home, a touch on the shoulder
aroused me. I turned and Percy stood by my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
side. The beauty of the evening had soothed his wild
and agitated feelings. He spoke of his wife with touching
regret, as if certain that she was lost to him forever.
For nearly an hour he stood gazing on the moon's
bright attendant, as if he fancied it her home.</p>

<p>At length he disappeared below, and again Ponto,
who seemed to be wrapped in a deep revery, was my
only companion. We had remained several minutes
in silence, when suddenly, as if it had dropped from
the clouds, a female form appeared far above us, on a
precipitous bluff that leaned out over the deep, on which
the solitary moonlight slept in unobstructed brightness.
The form advanced so near the brink of the fearful
crag, that we could even distinguish the color of her
drapery as it fluttered in the wind. By the motion of
her arms she seemed beckoning us on shore; then, as
if despairing to attract our attention, she looked fearfully
about, and the next moment a strain of exquisite
melody came floating down to us, like a voice from
heaven. We remained breathless, and could almost
distinguish the words.</p>

<p>The strain terminated in a startling cry, and with a
frantic gesture the figure tore a crimson scarf from her
neck, and shook it wildly on the winds; at the same
moment the dark form of a man leaped out on the
cliff. There was a short struggle, with reiterated
shrieks of 'help! help! help!' in a voice of agony,
and all disappeared in the deep shadow of another rock.</p>

<p>Ponto, who at the first burst of the song, had started
up and grasped my arm with a degree of wild energy
I had never witnessed in him before, now suddenly
released his hold, and with a single bound plunged into
the sea. So lost was I in amazement at the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
scene, that for a moment I remained undecided what
course to pursue; then, not wishing to alarm the ship,
I ordered Waters, the midshipman of the watch, to
jump into the boat with a few of the men, and pull
after him.</p>

<p>The head of my little favorite soon became visible
in the moonlight. With a vigorous arm he struck out
for the shore, and was immediately hid in the deep
shadow of its mural cliffs. A moment, and I again
saw him on the beetling rocks, whence the female had
just disappeared; then he, too, was lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>Waters, after being absent in the boat about half an
hour, returned without having discovered the least sign
of the fugitive. Hour after hour I awaited the return
of my adventurous boy, filled with painful anxiety.</p>

<p>As the night deepened, the clouds, which during the
day had slumbered on the mountain battlements, as if
held in awe by the majesty of the burning sun, rolled
slowly down the steeps and gradually spread out on the
sea, enveloping us in their humid embrace. A denser
mist I never saw; my thin clothing was soon wet
through and clinging to me like steel to a magnet, and
we were completely lost in darkness. As I paced the
deck, not willing to go below while my young favorite
was in peril, Waters tapped me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Did you notice any thing then, Mr. Hackinsack?
I thought I heard a splash in the water, like the dip of
an oar."</p>

<p>"Some fish, I suppose, Waters."</p>

<p>"I think not, Sir; besides, just now I saw a dark
object gliding slowly across our bow in the mist, which
I then took for a drifting log."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>I walked round the deck and peered into the fog on
every side, but could discover nothing. I listened; all
was silent save the tweet, tweet, of the lizards and the
roar of the surf, as it beat on the rocks astern. Presently
old Benjamin Ramrod, the gunner, came aft.</p>

<p>"I wish this infernal fog would clear up!" said he,
"for the last half hour, I have heard strange noises
about us! I am much mistaken, or we are surrounded
by enemies of some sort or other. When that shining
apparition arose from the bluff there, and began to
beckon to us, I said to myself, some accident is going
to happen before many hours, and you see if my pro'nostics
ar'n't true. Minded you how, by her sweet
voice, she lured that poor boy, Ponto, overboard?&mdash;and
even I, who may say I've had some experience in such
matters, began to feel a queerish sensation, as I harkened
to her witchery. Many a poor sailor has lost his
life by listening to their lonesome-like songs. I remember
once when I was on the coast of Africa, in a
gold-dust and ivory trader, we heard the water-wraiths
and mermaids singing to each other all night long,
and the very next day our ship was driven upon the
rocks in a white squall, and wrecked, and only myself
and a Congo nigger escaped alive, out of a crew of
twenty-three!&mdash;It strikes me, too," he continued, after
listening a moment, "that we shall have a storm before
morning; the fog seems to be brushing by us, and the
noise of the breakers on shore grows terribly loud. I
would give all the prize-money I ever gained to be out
of the place, with good sea-room, a flowing sheet, and
our bows turned toward home&mdash;no good ever came of
fighting these pirate imps.&mdash;Heaven help us! what is
that?" he exclaimed with a start, as a tall, white form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
shot up, a few rods under our stern, seen but dimly
through the fog.</p>

<p>The fact flashed upon me at once; our cable had
been cut; it was the spray of the breakers rebounding
from the shore. The best bower anchor was instantly
let go, which brought us up; not however till we had
drifted within a cable's length of the breakers, which
ramped and roared all the night with maddening violence,
as if eager to engulf us. The alarm was given,
and in a few minutes every thing was prepared for
any emergency that might occur.</p>

<p>I ordered Ramrod to clap a charge of grape into one
of the bow-chasers and let drive at the first object that
came in sight. As I gave the order the dip of oars
could be plainly distinguished, receding from our bows.
Benjamin did not wait to see the marauders, but fired
in the direction of the sound. The fog was swept
away before the mouth of the gun, to some distance,
and I caught a glimpse of a boat filled with men. A
deep groan told that the gun had been rightly directed.</p>

<p>There was now no doubt that we were surrounded
by enemies. It was only by the foreboding watchfulness
of the gunner that we were prevented from going
ashore, where, doubtless, the pirates expected to have
obtained an easy victory over us.</p>

<p>About ten minutes after this incident I was startled
by the faint voice of Ponto, hailing me from under the
schooner's side. I joyfully lowered the man-ropes, and
immediately had the adventurous boy beside me, on the
quarter-deck. He grasped my hand, and I felt him
tremble all over with eagerness.</p>

<p>"You heard that song; the voice was that of my
own sister! That shriek, too, was hers; do you wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that I leaped overboard? I scarcely know how I
reached the rock from which she was dragged. I
climbed up and up, in the direction I supposed they
must have taken, until I gained the very summit of one
of the hills. I looked down, and as it were floating in
the haze, many feet below me, saw the face of a rock
reddened by the blaze of a fire opposite. I clambered
from cliff to cliff, clinging to the branches of the trees,
and letting myself down by the mountain creepers that
hung like thick drapery over the descent, till all at
once I dropped over the very mouth of a deep cavern.
A massy vine fell in heavy festoons down over the
rugged pillars that formed its portal. Securing a foothold
among its tendrils, concealed by its luxuriant foliage,
I bent over and looked in. A large party of
fierce-looking men, with pistols in their belts and cutlasses
lying by them, were seated round a rude table,
feasting and making merry over their wine beakers. I
paid little attention to them, for against the rough wall
was an old woman, and leaning upon her&mdash;as I live, it
is true&mdash;was my own, my beautiful sister, she whom I
had left in England! I thought my heart would have
choked me, as I looked upon her pale, sorrowful face,
and heard her low sobs. In my tremor the vine shook;
some loose stones were started, and went clattering
down into the very mouth of the cavern. Two of the
pirates sprang up, and seizing a flaming brand, rushed
out. The red blaze flashed over her face as they
passed, and I heard them threaten her with a terrible
fate, if they were discovered through her means. At
the first start of the rocks I drew back into the vines,
where I remained breathless and still, while they scanned
the recesses of the crag. 'We were mistaken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Jacopo,' at length said one of them, 'it was probably a
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: less-used spelling for 'iguana'">guana</ins>,
drawn hither by the fire.' Satisfied that no one
was near, they returned to their comrades, who ridiculed
them for their temerity.</p>

<p>"Again I listened, and heard them plan to cut the
cable of the Dart, and run her into the breakers. If
they failed in this attempt, they were to haul the Sea-Sprite
out of her hiding place and leave the coast,
trusting, with the aid of the fresh land-breeze, to get
beyond pursuit before day-break.&mdash;The mist had come
on, and knowing it impossible to reach the Dart over
the rough precipices in time to give you warning, I remained
in my concealment, undecided what course to
pursue, when I saw a party of the pirates leave the
cavern to go to their boats. Perceiving beneath me,
on the bough of a wild tamarind, sundry articles of
clothing, similar to those worn by the bucaneers, a bold
thought occurred to me. When they had gone beyond
the light from the cave, I cautiously lowered myself
down, and drawing on a jacket and one of the caps,
jumped with them into the boat, no one in the darkness
suspecting me.</p>

<p>"To appearance we were in the very heart of the
mountains. I am certain that rocks and foliage were
piled up all around us.&mdash;After a short row we passed
through what seemed to be a deep chasm, between
two crags, which must have been very high, as the
darkness between them was almost palpable, and in a
few moments we were riding over the long swell of the
open sea. We groped about in the mist for some time,
till the position of the Dart was ascertained by the
chafing noise of one of her booms, when, gliding softly
up, with their sharp knives they cut her cable, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
began to drift astern. The strictest silence was enjoined
upon us all, so that had I moved or made the
least noise, as I had intended, my life had been the
forfeit. However, I had just made up my mind to run
all hazards, when the flame of the gun gleamed through
the fog. One of the pirates fell dead in the bottom of
the boat, and in the hurried stir which this produced, I
contrived to slip into the water.</p>

<p>"Now let me conjure you to take measures for the
rescue of my poor sister. How she came into their
power is a mystery. But my heart will break if she is
not soon freed from these lawless men."</p>

<p>I informed the captain of Ponto's discovery, but he
saw at once that it would be madness to attempt any
thing in our present situation, with sunken rocks around
us, the breakers astern, and a thick mist wrapping all
in obscurity.</p>

<p>At last, after a night of the most wearisome watching,
the day dawned, and the mists returned to their
mountain fastnesses. Burning for a brush with the
desperadoes, we towed the Dart out of her critical
situation and got her under sail. The launch and cutter
were ordered out, but here we were at fault. The
morning sunlight slept calmly on the forest clad ridges
and gray cliffs, and every irregularity and indentation
of the shore were strongly shadowed forth; but not the
least sign of harbor or anchorage could be seen, except
under the rocky promontory we had just left, and every
thing looked as forsaken and solitary as a creation's
birth. However, not doubting that we should be able
to sift the mystery, the boats put off, with full and well-armed
crews, and on nearing the shore discovered a
narrow inlet, that wound in between the two lofty cliffs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the one projecting out with a magnificent curve, so as
entirely to conceal the channel until we approached
within a few rods of the shore.</p>

<p>"We've got on the right scent of the old fox now,
I think," said Waters.</p>

<p>"Speak low, gentlemen; if discovered we may meet
with a reception here not altogether so agreeable&mdash;I
don't like the appearance of those grave looking fellows,
yonder," said Dacres, pointing to four cannon
mounted on a low parapet, with their muzzles bearing
directly toward us.</p>

<p>"Why, the place is as silent as a grave-yard," muttered
the old cockswain of the cutter.</p>

<p>We advanced softly up the inlet, and found it to
branch out into a broad basin. Here was explained
the mystery of the Sea-Sprite's sudden disappearance;
this was the <i>Pirate's Retreat</i>, and from their escaping
hither and into similar resorts known only to themselves,
arose the many wild stories that were abroad
respecting their supernatural prowess. Fifty well armed
men might have defended the place against five
hundred assailants, as there was only one point, the
inlet, susceptible of an attack. The entrance was not
more than thirty feet in width&mdash;only sufficient for one
vessel to enter at a time; but the water was bold and
deep, with a sandy bottom. An enormous cavern
yawned at the farther extremity of the basin, which
Ponto immediately recognized as that where the pirates
held their revel the previous night. But now the place
was evidently deserted; the Sea-Sprite had made her
escape.</p>

<p>The crew of the barge were despatched on shore to
explore the premises, while we, as a <i>corps-de-reserve</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
lay on our oars, with fire-arms loaded, ready for any
emergency. While waiting I had an opportunity of
surveying the magnificent scene around me. We lay
in the deep shadow of a beetling precipice of such immense
altitude, that the snow-white morning clouds, as
they floated onward, like messengers from heaven,
swept its summit. Thousands of gray sea-birds were
sailing around their eyries, along its dark craggy sides
far above us, while its hollow recesses reverberated
their shrill cries, till to our ears they sounded like one
continued scream. The cliffs all around were tumbled
about in the most chaotic confusion, as if they had been
upheaved by some tremendous throe of nature. Stinted
forest trees and brush wood, with here and there a
wild locust or banana, had gained a footing in the
seams and fissures of the crags, and thick masses of
the lusty mountain creepers, intertwined with wild
flowering jessamin and grenadilla, fell in gorgeous
festoons down the embattled heights, draping their
rough projections in robes of the most magnificent
woof. Nearly opposite was a yawning ravine, filled
with myriads of huge, shattered trees, ragged stumps,
loose stones and gravel, which probably had been
swept from the mountains, by the foaming torrents that
rush down to the sea in the rainy months. The desolation
of this scene was in a measure relieved by the
quick springing vegetation that had found sustenance
among the decayed trunks, and in the black earth that
still adhered to the matted roots; so that green foliage,
and wild flowers of the most brilliant dies in sumptuous
profusion, were waving and nodding over prostrate
trees, which perchance a year before, had stood up in
the pride of primeval lustihood, on the mountain ridges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Further back, beyond this gorge, the sloping steeps
were clothed with dark waving forests, stretching up
their sides, till they faded into the blue haze resting on
the mountain summits. The freshness of early day
had not yet been dissipated. Among the undergrowth
and brakes, on the tips of the tall, sweeping guinea
grass, and in the cups of the wild flowers, the pure
dews hung in glittering globules, sparkling with brilliant
prismatic tints, as they flashed back the glances
of the rising sun. Calmness and repose reigned over
the unequalled sublimities of the place; and although
the billows were madly beating and roaring against the
outer base of the crescent-like promontory, within, the
water was silent and unruffled by a breath, reflecting
in its depths the wild and gorgeous array of rock and
verdure around, almost as unwavering as reality itself;
and had it not been for the tiny wavelets that rippled
up a small sandy beach, adorning the water's edge
with a narrow frill of foam, its likeness to a broad sheet
of glass had been perfect.</p>

<p>At length, after the premises had been thoroughly
reconnoitered, the crew of the cutter were permitted to
go on shore. They were soon revelling amidst the
costly merchandize and the luxuries, with which the
cavern was gorged.</p>

<p>"Holloa, Price!" said Waters to a fellow mid, as he
came out of the cave, dragging an old hag of a woman
after him, apparently much against her will; "I've
found the presiding goddess of the place. Isn't she a
Venus?"</p>

<p>"Wenus indeed!" echoed the old beldame, "take
that, young madcap, and larn better how to treat a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
lady!" administering a thwack on his ear that sent
him staggering a rod from her.</p>

<p>Waters gathered himself together, and a general
laugh took place at his expense.</p>

<p>"A fair representative of the amorous goddess&mdash;quite
liberal with her love pats!" said Price in a tantalizing
tone.</p>

<p>"Confound the old hag," muttered the discomfited
mid, "if it were not a waste of good powder and ball,
I'd make a riddle of her in the twinkling of a grog-can!"</p>

<p>This female and one man, found wounded and languishing
on his pallet, were the only denizens of the
place.</p>

<p>"Croesus! what hav'nt we here?" exclaimed Price,
glancing over the medley of rich merchandize heaped
together in one of the apartments of the huge cavern;
"boxes of silks and satins, sashes, ribbons, lace, tortoise
shell!&mdash;whew!&mdash;I say, Waters, what heathen are
these pirates to let such a profusion of pretty gewgaws
lay here, which ought to be setting off the fairy forms
of the Spanish lasses! Now there's as handsome a piece
of trumpery as one often sees," tying a delicate crimson
silk <i>manta</i> about him&mdash;"as I'm a sinner I'll carry
that home to Nell Gray!&mdash;Ha! Burgundy wine?</p>

<div class="cpoem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Inspiring&mdash;divine<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Is the gush of bright wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis the life, 'tis the breath of the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Tis the&mdash;the&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Odds! but I must quicken my memory, and clear
my pipes with a can of the critter to get into the spirit
of song!"</p>

<p>He drew a beaker from the cask and took a deep
draught.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Capital, by Bacchus!" he exclaimed, smacking his
lips,&mdash;"Try it, Waters, these fellows fare like princes."</p>

<p>"Bear a hand, Mr. Price, and don't set the men a
bad example," thundered the first lieutenant, who had
stationed himself as a sentinel outside.</p>

<p>In the meantime the men had not been idle. The
sight of such a profusion of riches, all at their own
mercy, had turned their brains, and the confusion that
prevailed among the silks and finery would have rivalled
that of a London milliner's shop on a gala day.</p>

<p>But the voice of the lieutenant, as if by magic, restored
them to order, and Waters ordered the most
costly of the goods to be carried to the boats.</p>

<p>"An 'ai'nt it Roary McGran 'as found a nest o 'the
shiners," exclaimed a son of Erin, as he emerged, covered
with dirt, from a small, deep cavity at the inmost
extremity of the cavern, dragging after him a large
bag of doubloons,&mdash;"'Ai'nt them the beauties, Misther
Waters?&mdash;its what they're as plenty there as paraites
in a parson's cellar."</p>

<p>Half a dozen similar bags were brought to light;
besides which more than a score of boxes containing
rix dollars, and a great many parcels of coin of different
nations, silver and gold, tied up in old pieces of canvas,
were discovered.</p>

<p>"Some sport in sacking such a fortress as this,"
observed Price,&mdash;"no blood and plenty of booty! By
Jove, though, what a confounded pity it is we hav'nt a
ship of some size, that we might load her with these
silken goods? Our share of the prize money would
be a fortune to us."</p>

<p>While the men were ransacking the cavern, I had
climbed by a narrow foot-path to the top of a lofty bluff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
A small telescope, found in a hollow that had been
worked in the rock, assured me that this served as a
look-out station. It commanded a wide view of the
surrounding ocean, now tenanted only by the sun-beam
and solitude, if I except the presence of the Dart,
which sat <i>lilting</i> on the glittering swell, with her white
wings outspread, like a huge sea-bird stretching his
pinions for flight.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The boats shoved off, loaded gunwale deep with gold
and silver, ivory, tortoise-shell and the most choice of
the merchandise found in the cavern, and in fifteen
minutes all was safely secured on board the schooner.
After a short consultation it was agreed to run the
Dart into the Pirates' Retreat, and there await the return
of the Sea-Sprite, deeming that the bucaneers
would scarcely be long absent from the chief depository
of their treasures. She was soon safely anchored
in the basin. A lookout was stationed at the mouth of
the inlet, while Ponto and Percy undertook, with the
consent of the captain, the task of watching from the
cliff. Waters was then sent with a party of the men
to explore the cavern more thoroughly, and before noon
there was not a chink nor cranny of the place which
had not been thrice overhauled. Immense treasures,
in gold, silver and jewelry, were brought to light.</p>

<p>Toward the latter part of the afternoon, Percy gave
the signal agreed upon for an approaching vessel, and
directly after made his appearance on the beach, informing
us that they had examined her carefully, and
that there could be no mistaking her&mdash;it was the Sea-Sprite.</p>

<p>"Strange!" said the captain; "I knew that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
were brave&mdash;fearless to desperation, but I did not expect
to see them show such fool-hardiness. However,
they shall meet with a welcome reception. Mr. Dacres,
see that all the men are on board, and have things put
to rights for a brush. If I mistake not, there will be
desperate work ere the rascal receives his deserts."</p>

<p>In a few minutes every thing was ready; the boats
were got out forward, and the Dart was towed to the
mouth of the inlet, remaining concealed.</p>

<p>The Sea-Sprite, which could be seen from the outer
edge of the rocks, stood gallantly in, driving a drift of
snow before her, till within about a mile of the shore;
when, as if she had discovered some signs of our presence,
she wore round, hoisted her studd'n'sails, and
stood away in a south-westerly direction.</p>

<p>"Pull away cheerily," said the captain to the men in
the boats, who had lain on their oars in readiness.</p>

<p>Slowly the Dart emerged from her hiding place&mdash;the
sails were squared round so as to present their broad
surfaces to the wind, and away she darted in swift
pursuit, like an eagle in quest of his prey. A stern
chase is proverbially a long one; so it proved in this
instance. The wind was light, and although we hung
out every rag of sail, the sun was sinking beyond the
sea when we approached within gun-shot of the rover.
Not a soul could be seen on her decks,&mdash;she was worked
as if by magic.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ramrod," said the captain, "clap a round shot
into the long-tom, and let us see if we cannot make
them show some signs of life."</p>

<p>Benjamin loaded the gun, and having got it poised
to his fancy, applied the match. Away whizzed the
iron messenger. The chips flew from the stern of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
rover, and a swarm of grizzly heads, belonging to
<i>bona fide</i> bodies, popped up above the bulwarks, and
then settled down again, like so many wild sea-fowl
disturbed in their nests.</p>

<p>"Well done, Benjamin!&mdash;I see you have not lost
any of your skill for lack of practice."</p>

<p>The pirate, at length finding it impossible to escape
us, shortened sail.</p>

<p>"Now my men," said the captain, "to your duty!&mdash;let
every gun be double-shotted&mdash;a round shot and
grape!"</p>

<p>By a well-timed manoeuvre, we ranged up under
her stern. Our men stood with their arms extended,
ready to apply their lighted matches.</p>

<p>"Fire!" thundered Satan West.</p>

<p>A storm of flame burst from our side, and the Dart
reeled half out of water under the recoil of the overloaded
guns. The iron shower raked the pirate fore
and aft, hurling those deadly missiles, the splinters, in
every direction, and doing terrible execution on their
decks. Two more such broad-sides would have sent
her to the bottom.</p>

<p>"Helm aweather&mdash;jam hard!" roared the captain.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"&mdash;and we wore round so as to present
our other broad-side to the enemy.</p>

<p>While this manoeuvre was going on, the bows of
the Sea-Sprite had fallen off in the wind, so as to bring
us side by side, within half pistol shot. She returned
the fire with a vengeance, and several of our brave
tars fell wounded or slain to the deck.</p>

<p>"Ready! blaze away!"&mdash;but the sound of our captain's
voice was lost in the thunder of the heavy ordnance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The battle now commenced in real earnest. The
cannon bellowed, small arms rattled, the combatants
yelled, the dying groaned, the iron thunder-bolt crashed,
riving the vessel's oaken timbers, and a dense sulphur-cloud
overspread the scene of furious commotion,
so that we fought with an invisible enemy. We could
see nothing save the streaming lightning of the cannon,
or the fiend-like figures that worked our aftermost
guns, begrimmed with powder and blood, stripped
nearly naked, and sweltering in their eager toil. As
the smoke occasionally lifted, however, the battered
bulwarks of the enemy, and the glimmering streaks
along her black waist, showed that our fire had been
rightly directed; and the irregularity with which it was
returned, told the confusion that prevailed on her decks.
Several times we attempted to run her aboard, but they
discovered our intentions in time to avoid us.</p>

<p>At length a discharge from the well-directed gun of
old Benjamin, took effect in her fore-top. The topmast
came thundering down with all its rigging, over
the foresail. Having thus lost the benefit of her head
sail, she rounded to, and her jib-boom came in contact
with our fore rigging.</p>

<p>"Now is our time!&mdash;into her, boarders!" roared
Dacres, leaping upon the pirate's forecastle deck.</p>

<p>But the order was useless&mdash;they were already hard
on his track. A close and desperate struggle now took
place. Pistols cracked, sabres gleamed, and deadly
blows were dealt on either side, till a rampart of the
slain and wounded was raised high between the furious
combatants. Gloomy and dark as an arch-fiend, the
pirate leader raged among his men, urging them on
with threats and curses, in a voice of thunder, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sweeping down all opposition before his dripping blade.
But Dacres, backed by his well-trained boarders, received
them on the points of their pikes, with a coolness
and bravery that made them recoil upon each
other, like surges from a rock-ribbed coast. Thus the
fight continued with various success, till the attention
of the bucaneers was arrested by an unearthly shout
in the rear, and the tall figure of Percy was seen, laying
about him with whirlwind impetuosity, his long,
untrimmed hair flying wildly in the commotion of the
atmosphere, his features working with the madness
that controlled him, and his dilated eyes flashing with
a fierce, unnatural fire upon his opponents. All quailed
before him. Wherever his merciless arm fell there
was an instant vacancy. Although a score of cutlasses
were glancing, meteor-like, around his person, as if
by a spell, he remained uninjured. At length his eye
detected the pirate leader. Dashing aside all before
him, with one bound he was at his side. The fierce
chief started in amazement at the sight of him whom
he supposed many a league from the spot, if not dead,
but quickly recovered his stern and gloomy bearing.</p>

<p>"Monster! where is she?" shouted Percy.</p>

<p>"Ask the sharks!" replied the captain, lunging at
him with his sabre.</p>

<p>These were his last words. Percy, quick as thought,
drew a pistol from his belt and fired into his face! He
fell heavily to the deck, and the combatants closed
around him, as tempest-waves close over a foundering
ship!</p>

<p>The pirates, now that their leader was slain, fought
with less spirit, and the victory was soon decided in our
favor. Sooth to say, it was dearly earned; and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
who sought the battle with a quickened pulse, and
eager for the strife, were that evening consigned to the
waves. Of all the pirate's crew, consisting of nearly a
hundred men, but thirteen remained unharmed. Heavens!&mdash;what
a ghastly spectacle her decks presented!
Fifty stalwart forms lay there, stiffened in death, or
writhing in the agony of their deep wounds, severed
and mangled in every way imaginable; and so slippery
was the main deck that we could hardly cross it, while
the sea all around was died with the red waters of life,
that gushed in a continuous stream from her scuppers.</p>

<p>On the forecastle deck, where the last desperate
struggle had taken place, I recognized many of our
own crew among the lifeless heaps. Poor old Ramrod,
the gunner, lay there, with the black blood trickling
over his swarthy brow, from a bullet hole in his
temple. He had died while the might of battle was
yet upon him&mdash;and the fierce scowl which he darted
at his foes, still remained on his rigid features.
His hand, even in the agonies of death, had not relinquished
its firm grasp on his cutlass, and the gigantic
form of a swart pirate, with his skull cloven down,
close at hand, showed that it had been swayed to some
purpose. Poor Benjamin! I could have wept over
him. He had been in the service from his earliest
days, and the scars of many a sanguinary fight were
visible upon his muscular arms, and on his bronzed
and powerful chest. My brave boy, Ponto, was there
also, hanging pale and wounded over the britch of the
bow gun. He had followed me when we boarded,
like a young tiger robbed of his mate. Although faint
and helpless with the loss of blood, which belched at
every heave of his bosom, from a deep sabre wound in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
his shoulder, and which had completely saturated his
checked shirt and his duck pantaloons, yet his firmness
was unshaken. I ordered one of our men to take
charge of him, until he could be looked to by the surgeon.
"Not yet," faintly exclaimed the generous
child, pointing to Mengs, the boatswain, who lay wounded
over a coil of the cable, with three or four grim
looking bucaneers stretched dead across his chest, the
blood from their wounds streaming into his face and
neck,&mdash;"look to him first, he may be suffocated."</p>

<p>"No, no, youngster," murmured the hardy Briton,
"I'd do very well till my turn comes, if I had this
ugly looking craft cast off from my gun-deck, and a can
of water stowed away in my cable tier!"</p>

<p>After the prisoners were secured, I sought the cabin,
where I had ordered Ponto to be carried. It was a
richly garnished room, with berth hangings of crimson
damask and amber colored silk, a gorgeous carpet
from the looms of Brussels, and furniture in keeping.
Opposite the companion-way hung a superb picture of
the virgin mother and her infant, and over it a golden
crucifix, while beneath, on a rose wood table, lay a
guitar, implements for sketching, and various articles
for female employ and amusement. Indeed, one
might have supposed himself entering the boudoir of
a delicate Spanish belle, rather than the domicil of a
lawless rover. This I remember but from the glance
of a moment. My attention was drawn to the occupants
of the place. There lay my wounded boy, by
the side of a silken sofa-couch, his face buried in the
garments of a female stretched lifeless upon it, and
over them bent the tall form of Percy, gazing upon the
group with a fixed, vacant stare, which told that suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
could wring his soul no longer&mdash;desolation and
madness had come upon him. His attitude, the expression
of his features, and the low, convulsive sobs
and broken murmurs of the boy, at once explained the
scene. The one had found a wife, the other a sister,
in that inanimate form. I advanced nearer, in hopes
that life might not be altogether extinct. The sight
was appalling, but beautiful. The pale, dead face, upon
which the mellow radiance of sunset streamed
through the sky-light, was lovely as a seraph's. Her
eyes were closed as if in sleep; the long braids of her
bright hair lay undisturbed upon her marble forehead,
and there was no appearance of violence, save where
the dress of sea-green silk had been torn back from her
bosom, as if in her dying agonies, displaying a dark
puncture, as of a grape-shot, just below the snowy
swell of the throat, from which the crimson blood oozed,
slowly trickling down over her white and rounded
shoulder. She had probably been killed by our first
raking broad-side.</p>

<p>"Fire! fire!" shouted a dozen voices on deck. I
sprang up the companion-way. The fore-hatch had
been removed, and a dense volume of smoke was rolling
up from below. A glance was sufficient to show
that no effort of ours could save the vessel, and preparations
were speedily made to rescue the wounded,
and abandon her to her fate. It being impossible for
me to leave my duty on deck, I sent a trusty Hibernian
to rescue my helpless boy and to inform Percy of
our situation. He returned with a rueful countenance.</p>

<p>"Ochone! Mr. Hackinsack," said the tender hearted
fellow, "it almost made the salt wather come intil
my een, to see the poor man and the beautiful kilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
leddy,&mdash;an' whin I tould 'em as how the schooner was
burnin' and would be blown to Jerico in a twinklin' all
he said was to give me a terrible, ferocious-like scowl
and point with a loaded pistol to the companion; so I
took his mainin' an' left 'em."</p>

<p>Two other messengers, sent to take him away by
force, met with no better success.</p>

<p>The flames were ready to burst out on every side,
and from each chink and crevice around the hatches&mdash;which
had been replaced and barred down&mdash;the smoke
was darting up with the force of vapour from a steam
engine. The deck had become so heated that it was
painful to stand upon it&mdash;the fire was fast progressing
towards the run, where the magazine was situated.
Thrice had the order been given to quit the burning
vessel, but I could not forsake my friend without one
more effort to rescue him from the terrible fate that
awaited him, if left behind. He still held the loaded
pistol in his hand and sternly forbade my approach.
Poor Ponto had fainted from grief and loss of blood,
and lay across his sister's body. I sprang forward and
raised him in my arms, regardless of the maniac's
threats. The pistol banged in my ear, but fortunately
the ball passed over me as I stooped, and I regained
the companion-way without injury. By this time, he
had drawn another from his belt.</p>

<p>"Put away the pistol, and come with me," I urged,&mdash;"the
vessel is on fire and will soon be blown to atoms."</p>

<p>He looked at me with a grim stare for a moment,
then burst into an idiotic laugh. That wild laugh is
still ringing in my brain. "Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;Fire?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fire? here it is, wreathing and coiling!&mdash;here! here!"
dashing his hand against his forehead.</p>

<p>Perceiving that it was vain to reason with his madness,
and fearing for the life of the wounded boy in
my arms, I reluctantly left the hapless man to his fate.</p>

<p>The boat had already put off for the last time, but
I succeeded in prevailing upon them to return, and
leaping in, soon reached the Dart in safety.</p>

<p>The night set in wild and black as Death. Disparted
and ragged masses of cloud were rushing over the
face of the heavens, where once and again, the soaring
moon, and that same bright, solitary star, would show
their calm faces through the reeling rack, apparently
flying from this scene of turmoil and death. The increasing
wind howled mournfully through the rigging,
and our battered hull staggered along the inky main
writhing and shuddering on the heave of the surge like
a weary, wounded thing.</p>

<p>We followed in the track of the burning vessel as
she fled along before the gale, awaiting in breathless
suspense the consummation of her wild career. The
black smoke, interfulgent with tortuous tongues of lurid
fire, rolled in immense volumes over her!&mdash;the red
flames darted up her masts, along the spars and rigging,
and gushed in swirling sheets from her ports and
bulwarks, while in their fierce gleams, the billows
that ramped and raved about her, glowed like a huge
seething cauldron of molten iron, and the gloomy clouds
that lowered above were tinged in their ragged borders,
as with blood. Occasionally the jarring thunder
of her cannon, as they became heated to explosion,
announced to us the progress of the insidious destroyer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>But a still more thrilling spectacle awaited us. In
the height of the conflagration, the hapless Percy,
bearing his dead wife in his arms, emerged as it were
from the very midst of the flames, and took a stand on
the companion-way. So strongly was the tall, dark-figure
relieved against the glowing element, that his
slightest gesture could not escape our scrutiny. While
with one arm he spanned the waist of the supple corse,
which apparently struggled to escape from his grasp,
he waved the other on high as if exulting in the whirl
and commotion around him. He seemed like the minister
of some dark rite of heathenism, preparing to offer
up a victim to the Moloch of his superstition.</p>

<p>At length arrived the dreadful moment! The black
hull seemed to be lifted bodily out of the water. A
volume of smoke burst over her like the first eruption
of a volcano! A spire of flame shot up to the heavens,
filling the firmament with burning fragments, while
the clouds that overhung the sea, were torn and scattered
by the tremendous concussion. A crash followed&mdash;a
deep, bellowing boom, as if the solid globe had
split asunder!&mdash;then all was darkness&mdash;dreary, void,
silent as death!</p>

<h2><a name="RELIGIOUS_OBLIGATION_IN_RULERS" id="RELIGIOUS_OBLIGATION_IN_RULERS"></a>RELIGIOUS OBLIGATION IN RULERS.</h2>

<h3>By John W. Chickering.</h3>


<p>It is a great truth, and worthy of a place among the
few grand principles which lie at the foundation of all
wise and just government, that 'the Most High ruleth
in the kingdom of men.' This may be understood <i>de
jure</i>, or <i>de facto</i>; and in either sense must be believed,
not only by those who admit, on the authority of the
prophet, that it was spoken by a divine voice, but by
all who do not deny the whole theory of an overruling
Providence.</p>

<p>That the almighty Ruler retains both a right and an
agency in the management of terrestrial governments,
is undisputed by all who recognize his right and his
agency in any thing. It is the atheist alone who would
insulate the kingdoms of the earth from the kingdom
of heaven. None would banish Jehovah from the
smaller empires his providence has organized and sustained,
but those who banish him from the universe his
power has created.</p>

<p>Thus atheism in philosophy is sole progenitor of
atheism in politics; and it should not excite our surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
that he who 'sees' <i>not</i> 'God in clouds nor hears
him in the wind,'&mdash;who beholds in the great things of
the earth, the air and the sea, no footsteps of divine
power, and no finger-prints of divine wisdom, should be
equally blind concerning the progress of civil affairs,
and should so have perverted his mind, and so tortured
the moral sense which God gave him, as to believe,
and to rejoice, that without God, kingdoms rise and
fall, and that it is <i>not</i> 'by him' that 'kings reign, and
princes decree justice.'</p>

<p>But with the atheist, that moral monster,'&mdash;&mdash; horrendum,
informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum,' we
are not now concerned. We leave him to the darkness
he has brought upon himself through his 'philosophy
and vain deceit,' and to the enjoyment, if enjoyment
it be, of his dreary cavern, more dreary than that
of Polyphemus,&mdash;a godless world.</p>

<p>We come to inquire, by way of preparation for
the more direct prosecution of the object of this article,
concerning the views entertained by the great mass of
mankind who believe in the existence and providence
of Jehovah, as to his particular connection with the
subordinate governments on earth, and the station
which it is his holy pleasure to occupy in their control
and management. And here we find at once, wide
and hurtful mistakes; occupying relatively, such is
man's tendency to extremes, the position of antipodes.
Some, overlooking the twofold agency, partly civil,
partly ecclesiastical, by which the Most High promotes
his own ends and the well being of his creatures, have
resolved each into the other, making religion an affair
of the state, and civil government a matter for ecclesiastical
influence; producing in practice the unseemly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
compound, commonly called "church and state," but
which might be more accurately characterized as the
ruin of both.</p>

<p>As the fruits of this mistake, the world has seen profane
monarchs invested with titles of religion and piety.
In some countries, aided by ambition and intrigue, it
has brought kings to kiss the feet of the professed ambassadors
of Jesus Christ; and gained for them honors
and power, which their divine but humble master declined
for himself. This mistake has been confirmed,
if it was not originated, by the organization of the great
Jewish theocracy. This was, indeed, church and
state. But it was under a divine administration.&mdash;And
although the fact that the Deity not only attested and
ratified the alliance, but condescended to be legislator,
judge, and executive, might at once have prevented
the inference; yet men <i>have</i> inferred that the civil and
ecclesiastical powers ought always to be thus commingled.
The consequences might have been anticipated.
The history both of Christianity and of the world, is
darkened by their melancholy shade. Religion, unguarded
by the miraculous intervention of Him who,
under a former dispensation, smote the offerers of
strange fire, has been corrupted by those who would
do her honor, and crushed by the embraces of false
friends;&mdash;and her splendid sojourn in the halls of power,
has been met by reverses not less striking, and far
more disastrous, than Moses met after being the <i>protege</i>
of royalty; while the civil rights of men, invaded
by ambition and avarice, under the name of religion,
and with the sanction of God's name, have been yielded
up without a struggle, under the impression, that
resistance would be "fighting against God." What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
would not have been demanded in the name of man, has
been freely given in the name of God;&mdash;men who in
defence of their rights, would have ventured cheerfully
upon treason, have shrunk with horror from sacrilege.</p>

<p>Thus religion and liberty have well-nigh perished
together, and their present resting-place on earth resembles
rather the one found by Noah's dove on her
second flight, than the broad home, illimitable but by
the world's circumference, which as philanthropists we
hope, and as Christians we pray, they may soon enjoy.</p>

<p>Others again, warned, perhaps, by the disasters consequent
upon the policy last described, have gone to
the extreme, not less hurtful, and far more presumptuous,
of excluding religious motives and religious principles
from all influence in the affairs of the commonwealth.
They have thus become <i>quoad hoc</i>, practical
atheists. Content indeed, that the Deity should keep
our planet in motion, and regulate its seasons and its
tides; and surround and cover it with the blessings of
Providence, nor careful to forbid him a participation
even in the <i>internal</i> concerns of Jupiter, or Herschell,&mdash;perhaps
even willing to admit in theory, the truth of
the statement from the inspired record with which this
article commenced,&mdash;they yet deem it best for man,
considered either as a governing or as a governed being,
that the notion of a presiding Deity should be as
much as possible excluded from his mind. The mere
juxtaposition of the words "religion" and "politics,"
or any of their correlates, is sufficient to excite the
fears of these scrupulous alarmists; and if they do not
imitate the example of the French, who were seen
near the close of the last century, rushing madly with
the pendulum-like oscillation of human nature, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the bonds of religious despotism, into the very wilderness
of atheism, and denounce Jehovah as a usurper,
and his adherents as rebels against "the powers that
be," they strive to separate all questions and acts of
government from God and his laws, as if there <i>were</i>
no God; thus making, if not an atheistic people, an
atheistic government. Far otherwise, we cannot but
pause here to remark, acted the noble men, the sifted
wheat of three kingdoms, who were thrown by God's
providence through ecclesiastical tyranny, upon these
shores. If they for a time, with a strange tenacity of
old habits, which showed that principle, not passion,
led them, clung to the very usages respecting toleration,
which had exiled them, they at least preserved
the nation which they founded, from the character and
the curse of a nation which despises God. Heaven
grant, that the pendulum may not even now be swinging
to the other extreme!</p>

<p>While we would have the affairs of the nation managed
as if there were no <i>church</i> in the world, we would
not have them managed as if there were no <span class="smcap">God</span> in the
world. Could our voices reach the millions of our
countrymen, as Joshua's voice reached the thousands
of Israel, we would say as he said, '<span class="smcap">If the Lord be
God, serve him</span>.' In a word, while we believe that
the civil and ecclesiastical departments ought to be
distinct, and that their union is a departure from the
intention of Him who formed both, and that it is
fraught with the most disastrous consequences to both,
we do <i>not</i> believe that the almighty Ruler has excluded
himself from the control of either, or given the least
permission that either should be managed on any other
principles than the eternal principles of right, which are
embodied in his character, and laid down in his word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>When we speak of a sense of religious obligation,
we mean more than a general undefined belief that
such an obligation exists. Such a belief is withheld,
we trust, by comparatively few who hold important
places in our national and State governments. But can
it be doubted by any man who has accustomed himself
to contemplate the distinction between mere intellectual
assent, and the warm, practical conviction which reaches
the heart, and controls the conduct, that this belief
may coexist with as total an insensibility to the claims
of Jehovah, as if it were William IV., or Nicholas of
Russia, who performed them, instead of the Most High
God?</p>

<p>Is it too much to desire, nay to infer, as a <i>duty</i>, from
what has already been said, that our rulers in the executive,
legislative, and judicial departments, both in
the general and State governments, should have <i>an
abiding consciousness of accountability</i>&mdash;should live
under <i>a felt pressure of obligation</i>&mdash;to the Sovereign
of the universe, which should assume, as it must where
it exists at all, a practical, binding force? Is it too
much to ask, that they should remember that they are
the servants of God for good to this great people, and
that to their own Master they stand or fall? That they
rule by God's permission, and for his ends; and that a
higher tribunal than any on earth awaits the termination
of their responsibility to man? That they should
remember their obligation, in common with those who
elevated them to office, "whatever they do, to do all to
the glory of God;" and the solemn truth, that a sin
against God or man, whether of omission or of commission,
whether committed in private, in the family
circle, or in the high places of authority, is no less a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
sin, when committed by a judge, or a legislator, or a
chief magistrate of a State or nation, than by the
humblest of his constituents? In a word, do we claim
too prominent a place for religious principle in the administration
of public affairs, when we avow our desire
that the rulers of a people, who are the nominal, and
in a free government the <i>real</i>, representatives of the
people, should be daily and practically aware, that they
are accountable to a higher Power, thus realizing, if
not in the highest and most Christian sense, yet in the
literal signification, the picture of a good ruler drawn
by the prophet, who, in the name of the almighty
Ruler, declares, "He that ruleth over men, must be
just&mdash;<i>ruling in the fear of God</i>!"</p>

<p>We cannot reflect without occasion for the deepest
gratitude, that in contemplating the advantages of such
a state of mind and of heart, as possessed by men in
authority, we are not confined to <i>a priori</i> reasoning.
England has had her Alfred, her Edward VI., and her
Matthew Hale; Sweden her Gustavus Adolphus; our
own most cherished and beloved country, a Washington,
and a Wirt, with many others among the dead,
and not a few among the living, to whom our readers
may recur as we proceed, both for illustration of our
meaning, and proof of our assertions.</p>

<p>Among the effects of this sense of obligation, which
go to show its importance to every man in public life,
we mention first, <i>its influence in checking the love and
pride of power</i>. It will not be said by any man, who
has acquired even a smattering of the science of human
nature, that the simplicity of our republican institutions
excludes all danger from this source. It is the
great weakness of man, to desire power; and, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
it, to be proud of it; and, in his pride, to abuse it. It
matters not whether it be the power of a monarch on
his throne, or of the humblest village functionary. If
it be <i>power</i>, or even the semblance of power, it charms
the eye of the expectant, and, too often, turns the head
of the possessor.</p>

<p>True, in this land, power walks in humble guise.
She rides in no gilded chariot&mdash;is clothed with no robes
of state&mdash;is preceded by no heralds with announcement
of noble titles&mdash;is decorated with no ribbons and
stars. Nor is there an office worth seeking, as a matter
of gain, except in some special cases, growing
rather out of individual character and circumstances,
than from design on the part of legislators. But who
will deny, that <span class="smcap">rank</span>, here, as elsewhere throughout the
wide world, has its attractions? And who, that has
thought upon the subject carefully, doubts that they are
as strong, as if it were hereditary? As far as pride of
heart in the possessor is concerned, undoubtedly the
temptation is even greater. That rank is <i>not</i> hereditary,
and is therefore attainable by individual effort, opens a
fountain of ambition in a thousand hearts, which, under
another constitution of society, would never have known
ambition, but as <i>a strange word</i>, while the fact that it
is ordinarily the prize of talent, attaches to it an additional
power to tempt and seduce the mind. It need
not be said, that so far as this love and pride of power
exists, it tends to subvert all the true ends of government.</p>

<p>That the influence of a sense of subordination and
accountableness to the Supreme Being, will be direct
and strong in checking these tendencies of human nature,
is so plain as to command assent without argument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Who can be proud in the perceived presence
of infinite splendor and worth? How can ambition
thrive under the overshadowing greatness of almighty
Power?</p>

<p>It is recorded of Gustavus Adolphus, that being surprised
one day by his officers in secret prayer in his
tent, he said: "Persons of my rank are answerable to
God alone for their actions; this gives the enemy of
mankind a peculiar advantage over us; an advantage
which can be resisted only by prayer and reading the
Scriptures." This remark, though it does not specify
the moral dangers to which the royal worshipper was
exposed, has reference, undoubtedly, in part, if not
mainly, to that pride and loftiness of heart, which are
the unrestrained denizens of those high regions in the
social atmosphere, which lie above the common walks
of life. Let a man in one of the high places of the
earth, be accustomed only <i>to look down</i>, and he is
ready like Herod of old, to fancy the flattery, truth,
which tells him he is a god;&mdash;let him <i>look up</i>;&mdash;there
Jehovah sitteth above the water floods and remaineth
king forever!</p>

<p>Another important effect of such views of religious
obligation, will be seen <i>in restraining the blind and
ruinous excess of party feeling</i>. He is a short-sighted
politician indeed, who utters a sweeping denunciation
of party distinctions. And if they may be harmless,
and even in some cases form the very safety of the nation,
then party <i>feeling</i>, without which <i>parties</i> could
not exist, is, in some of its degrees and developements
right and desirable. But like the lightning of heaven,
while it purifies the political atmosphere, how easily
and how quickly may it desolate and destroy! In its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
healthful action, it is like the gentle breeze, which refreshes
man and fertilizes the earth; in its excess, like
the tornado, which sweeps away every green thing, and
even upturns the foundations of many generations.</p>

<p>When it is a modification of true-hearted patriotism,
seeking the public good by party organizations, it is
right and safe; but when it is the offspring of the
wicked selfishness, already described, it is restrained
by no bounds, and directed to no good end. When a
public officer, of whatever rank, becomes the servant
of a party, instead of being a servant of God, for good
to the <i>people</i>, it is not difficult to foresee the consequences.</p>

<p>No argument is necessary to show that he who feels
himself accountable to God, will be but slightly constrained
by the bonds of party influence. So far as he
regards the ends of a party as accordant with the true
ends of government, which in some cases may be
nothing more than the truth, and in others nothing <i>less</i>&mdash;his
sense of religious obligation will of course not interfere
with his diligent prosecution of those ends.
But at that critical point, where ends zeal for party,
for the sake of the common weal, and begins zeal for
party, for the party's sake, and for ambition's sake,
there a sense of paramount obligation, like the magnetic
power, will still the whispers of selfishness, and
counteract the tendencies of party commitment. The
Christian politician knows no party but the party of
patriots, or, if that party be divided, he seeks not the
building up of either fragment for its own sake&mdash;but
the building up on the best and most hopeful, or if
need be, on the ruins of both, the great fabric of public
welfare. Who does not desire to see a deep sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of allegiance to one who is our Master, pervading the
leaders and the adherents of the great political parties,
into which it is so common and perhaps necessary, for
nations to be divided?&mdash;under such an influence, how
might excesses be restrained, needless repellances be
neutralized, and how soon, instead of fierce bands of
brethren gathered in distinct and opposing array, like
the dark clouds of summer, meeting over our heads,
might we see the beauty and the strength of party organization,
without its wide severance and its deadly
hate, like the rainbow, which is not more beautiful in
the variety of its colors, than in the grace with which
the divine Painter has blended them.</p>

<p>It will be denied by none, of whatever religious or
political faith, that public morals are, under a government
like ours, the life-blood of national strength and
safety. The day that shall behold us a nation of gamblers,
or duelists, or profane swearers or drunkards, or
Sabbath-breakers&mdash;will be the day of our political
death. Armies, and navies, and enterprise, and numbers,
with a sound hereditary government, may for a
time give prosperity to a dissolute immoral people.
But in a government like ours, where the laws and the
administration of law, are as quickly and as certainly
affected by the popular sentiment, owing to frequent
elections, as the sunbeams are reflected from the summer
clouds, prosperity cannot survive morality a single
day. And who can tell how important, in this
view, it is, that our public men should be public models
of private virtue!</p>

<p>Oh, when, our hearts exclaim, when shall the <i>evil</i>
example be unknown in the high places of power; and
purity, truth, high-toned Christian morality, beam like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
another sun, from the seats of influence? The true
answer to this question would afford another argument
for the importance of that sense of religious obligation
which has now been considered. The command of
God is the only mandate in the universe which can effectually
restrain human passions and desires. The
voice which comes attended by the sanction, "Thus
saith the Lord," is the only voice which can successfully
say, "peace! be still," to the winds and the
waves of wrong inclination. When our rulers shall
"all be taught of God,"&mdash;and yield themselves to a
constraining sense of his dominion, and their own accountableness&mdash;then,
and not till then, will they as a
body, be such models of private correctness and virtue,
as many of them, both among the dead and among the
living, have been, for the imitation of the young men,
the hope and glory of our land.</p>

<p>Again, and it is the last consideration we shall present,
how powerful a tendency would such views on
the part of our rulers, possess, to awaken the utmost
vigilance in the guardianship of their sacred trust, and
to elevate the mind and heart to the purest feelings,
and the noblest efforts.</p>

<p>A sense of accountability, in some manner and to
some tribunal, is essential to ensure fidelity under all
temptations to indolence or perversion, in every case
in which men are the recipients of any trust. Apply
this principle to the case of him who holds some political
station of high importance. He feels himself responsible,
not only to men, but to God. He knows
and remembers that he is the <i>servant of God</i> for good,
to the people. This remembrance and impression is
the sheet anchor of his steadfastness. Other principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
<i>might</i> hold him amidst the storms and commotions of
the popular sea, and of his own heart; this <i>must</i>.
With what care will he watch the precious trust, which
comes to him under the seal of heaven! How sedulously
will he guard the doors of the temple of liberty,
when he perceives within it the altar of God, and finds
his sentinel's commission countersigned with the handwriting
of Jehovah! His heart, too, will be filled with
the purest and most exalted sentiments.</p>

<p>The fountain from which such a man daily drinks,
sparkles with the elements of all that is grateful and
refreshing.</p>

<p>The purest patriotism, the sweetest charities of domestic
life, the most expansive and wise benevolence,
all spring up in the heart together, the consentaneous
and harmonious fruits of the love and fear of God. It
was in the same school that Wilberforce learned to
love the slave&mdash;Howard to love the prisoner&mdash;Wirt to
love his country&mdash;and all to love the world. They
<i>feared and obeyed God</i>&mdash;and all noble and generous
emotions grow spontaneously in the soil of the heart
thus prepared and enriched.</p>

<p>Nor is the effort less marked or less salutary upon
the <i>mind</i>. Its thoughts are loftier, and its purposes
deeper and more steadfast, for being conversant with
the great subject of divine obligation. No man can
think much of the Deity, and realize strongly His constant
presence and inspection, without an elevation of
views, and a growing consciousness of that mental
power, for the right use of which he is accountable to
Him who bestowed it. We were not made to inhabit
a godless world, and we cannot make it so, in speculation
and in practice, without a deterioration analogous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to the dwarfish tendency of emigration to a region
colder than our native clime. "God is a sun," to the
mental as well as to the moral powers; and in the frozen
zone of practical atheism, both degenerate and die.
The noble motto, "<i>Bene orasse est bene studisse</i>," applies
with hardly less force to secular, than to sacred
studies.</p>

<p>With what energy must it arm the soul of the patriot
statesman struggling against wrong counsels, and
discredited dangers, to know that the God of truth and
of right, sees and approves his course! With what
new power does his mind grasp a difficult and embarrassed
subject, when he feels that the Former of that
mind, now demands from him an exertion of its highest
powers! What exciting power, to call forth the
most thrilling eloquence, can be found in the crowded
senate-chamber, compared with the consciousness that
for every word he must give account to Him, whose
applause, if he fulfils his high behest, will surpass in
value the shouts of an enraptured universe besides!</p>

<h2><a name="A_NEW-ENGLAND_WINTER-SCENE" id="A_NEW-ENGLAND_WINTER-SCENE"></a>A NEW-ENGLAND WINTER-SCENE.</h2>

<h3>EXTRACT FROM A LETTER TO A FRIEND IN ONE OF THE
WEST INDIA ISLANDS.</h3>

<h3>By William Cutter.</h3>


<p>I have sometimes almost envied you the perpetual
summer you enjoy. You have none of the bleak, dark
wastes of Winter around you, and have never to look,
with aching heart, upon all fair, bright, beautiful things,
withering before your eyes, in the severe frown of frosty
Autumn. It is always green, and fresh, and fragrant,
in your Islands of eternal June. Your gardens
are always gardens, gay and redolent with sweet blossoms,
and rich with ripe fruits, mingling like youth
and manhood vying with each other, "from laughing
morning up to sober prime," pursuing, without blight
or dimness, the same gay round&mdash;blooming and ripening&mdash;ripening
and blooming, but never falling, through
all generations. Through all seasons, you have only
to reach forth your hands, and there are bright bouquets,
and mellow, delicious fruits, ready to fill them.
Your trees have always a shade to spread over you;
and they cast off their gorgeous blossoms, and their
luxuriant load, as if they were conscious of immortal
youth and energy&mdash;as if they knew they should never
fade, become fruitless, or die. There is no frail,
bending, withering age, in any thing of nature you look
upon&mdash;no blasting of the unripened bud by untimely
frosts&mdash;no falling prematurely of all that is beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and rare, to remind you daily that time is on his flight,
and that you will not always be young. I wonder you
do not think yourselves immortal in those everlasting
gardens! Oh! that perpetual youth and maturity of
every thing lovely!&mdash;how I have sometimes envied you
the possession!</p>

<p>But I shall never envy you again. No&mdash;delightful
as summer is, soft as its breezes, and sweet as its music,
I would not lose the unutterable glory of this scene,
that is now before me, for all the riches of your Island,&mdash;its
unfading summer, and everlasting sweets. I
wish I could describe it to you&mdash;could give you some
faint idea of its celestial splendor. But, to do it any
justice, I should have travelled through the fields of
those glittering constellations above me, to borrow images
from the host of heaven. The attempt will be
vain&mdash;presumptuous&mdash;but I will try to tell you as much
of it as I can.</p>

<p>The day has been dark, cold, and stormy. The
snow has been falling lightly, mingled with rain, which,
freezing as it fell, has formed a perfect covering of
ice upon every object. The trees and shrubbery, even
to their minutest branches, are all perfectly encased in
this transparent drapery. Nothing could look more
bleak and melancholy while the storm continued. But,
just as evening closed in, the storm ceased, and the
clouds rolled swiftly away. Never was a clearer, a
more spotless sky. The moon is in the zenith of her
march, with her multitude of bright attendants, pouring
their mild radiance, like living light, upon the
sea of glass that is all around us. Oh! how it kindles
me to look at it! how it maddens me that I have no
language to tell it to you! Do but imagine&mdash;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
fields blazing out, like oceans of molten silver!&mdash;every
tree and shrub, as far as the eye can reach, of pure
transparent glass&mdash;a perfect garden of moving, waving
breathing chrystals, lighted into unearthly splendor by a
full, unclouded moon, and scattering undimmed, in every
direction, the beams that are poured upon them. The
air, all around, seems alive with illuminated gems. Every
tree is a diamond chandelier, with a whole constellation
of stars clustering to every socket&mdash;and, as they
wave and tremble in the light breeze that is passing, I
think of the dance of the morning stars, while they
sang together on the birth-day of creation. Earth is a
mirror of heaven. I can almost imagine myself borne
up among the spheres, and looking through their vast
theatre of lights. There are stars of every magnitude&mdash;from
the humble twig, that glows and sparkles on
the very bosom of the glassy earth, and the delicate
thorn that points its glittering needle to the light, to the
gorgeous, stately tree, that lifts loftily its crowned head
and stretches its gemmed and almost overborne arms,
proudly and gloriously to the heavens&mdash;all glowing&mdash;glittering&mdash;flashing&mdash;blazing&mdash;like&mdash;but
why do I attempt
it? As well might I begin to paint the noon-day
sun. Give a loose to your imagination. Think of
gardens and forests, hung with myriads of diamonds&mdash;nay,
every tree, every branch, every stem and twig, a
perfect, polished crystal, and the full, glorious moon,
and all the host of evening, down in the very midst of
them&mdash;and you will know what I am looking at. I am
all eye and thought, but have no voice, no words to
convey to you an impression of what I see and feel&mdash;No,
I'll not envy you again! What a picture for
mortal eyes to look on undimmed! The eagle, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
goes up at noon-day to the sun, would be amazed in its
effulgence. It is the coronation-eve of winter&mdash;and
nature has opened her casket, and poured out every
dazzling gem, and brilliant in her keeping, and hung out
all her rain-bow drops, and lighted up every lamp, and
they are all glowing, twinkling, sparkling, flashing together,
like legions of spiritual eyes, glancing from
world to world, in such unearthly rivalry, that the eye,
even of the mind, turns away from it, pained and weary
with beholding. There&mdash;look&mdash;but I can say no
more, my words are consumed, drunk up in this unutterable
glory, like morning mist when the sun looks
on it!</p>

<h2><a name="LOCH_KATRINE" id="LOCH_KATRINE"></a>LOCH KATRINE.</h2>

<h3>By N. H. Carter.</h3>


<p>An eminence in the road afforded us the first view of
Loch Katrine, a blue and bright expanse of water, cradled
among lofty hills, though moderate both in point
of altitude and boldness, when contrasted with those
which had already been seen. The first feature that
arrested attention, was the peculiar complexion of the
water, which is cerulean, and differs several shades
from that of the other Scotish lakes. Its hue is probably
modified by the verdure upon the shores, as well
as by the geological structure of its bed, in which there
is little or no mud. Like some of our own pellucid
waters, it is a Naiad of the purest kind, sleeping on
coral and crystal couches. Its blue tinge was doubtless
in some degree heightened by the distance whence
it was first descried, as well as by the deep azure of
the skies after the late storm.</p>

<p>Hastening to the shore, we waited some time for the
oarsmen, who accompanied us from Loch Lomond, to
bring out their boat from behind a little promontory,
which for aught I know, was the very place where
Rob Roy and Ellen Douglas used to hide their canoes.
There is no house within several miles of the landing.
The only building of any kind is a small temporary
hut, of rude construction, serving as a poor shelter in
case of rain. As this lake has become a fashionable
resort, one would suppose the number of travellers
would justify the expense of a boatman's house, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
would relieve the oarsmen from the trouble of walking
half a dozen miles, and the tourist from the vexation of
paying for it.</p>

<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, seven of us, including
the boat's crew, embarked, and commenced a
voyage to the foot of the lake, a distance of nine miles
in a south-eastern direction. Winds and waves both
conspired to accelerate our progress, and no Highland
bark probably ever bounded more merrily over the blue
billows. The cone of Ben-Lomond rapidly receded,
and Ben-venue and Ben-an, on opposite sides of the
outlet, came more fully in view. At the head, Glengyle
opens prettily from the north-west, with serrated
hills forming the lofty ramparts of the pass, in the entrance
of which is a seat belonging to one of the descendants
of Rob Roy M'Gregor. The width of the
lake is about two miles, with deeply indented shores,
which are generally bold and romantic, exhibiting occasionally
scattered houses and patches of cultivation,
particularly on the north-eastern borders. Our course
was nearest the south-western side, touching at one
little desolate promontory, to exchange boats, and often
approaching so close, as to enable us to examine the
scanty growth upon the margin.</p>

<p>In about two hours from the time of embarkation,
we reached Ellen's Island, near the outlet; and half
encircling the green eminence, rising beautifully from
the bosom of the lake, our Highland mariners made a
port in the identical little bay, where the far-famed
heroine was wont to moor her skiff, fastening it to an
oak, which still hangs its aged arms over the flood.
This miniature harbor is also signalized, as the place
where Helen Stuart cut off the head of one of Cromwell's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
soldiers. As the story goes, all the women and
children fled hither for refuge. After a decisive victory,
one of the veterans of the Protector attempted to
swim to the island for a boat, with an intention of pillaging
and laying waste the asylum; but as he approached
the shore the above mentioned heroine, stepped
from her ambuscade, and with one stroke of her
dirk decapitated the marauder, thus rescuing her narrow
dominion with its tenants from destruction.</p>

<p>The Island is small and rises perhaps fifty feet above
the water. It rests on a basis of granite, covered with
a thin coat of earth, through which the rocks occasionally
appear, and which affords scanty nutriment to a
growth of oak, birch, and mountain ash. The red berries
of the latter hung gracefully over the cliffs, in many
places shaded with brown heath. A winding pathway
leads to the summit, which is beautifully tufted,
and affords a charming view of the surrounding hills
and waters.</p>

<p>In a little secluded copse near the top stands Ellen's
Bower, fashioned exactly according to the description
of the same object in the Lady of the Lake. Those
who are curious to form a minute and accurate image
of it, have only to turn to that picture. The exterior
is composed of unhewn logs or sticks of fir, fantastically
arranged, with a thatched, moss-covered roof, and
skins of beasts converted into semi-transparent parchment
for windows. Every thing within is in rustic
style. A living aspen grows in the centre, and supports
the ceiling. Upon its branches hangs a great
variety of ancient armor, with trophies of the chase.
Here may be seen the Lochaber axe, Rob Roy's dirk,
and sundry other curiosities. A table strewed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
leaves extends nearly the whole length of the bower.
The walls are hung with shields, and the skins of various
animals. Chairs and sofas woven of osiers fill the
apartment. The chimney is formed of sticks, and the
head of a stag with his branching horns decorates the
mantlepiece. Half an hour was passed in lolling upon
Ellen's sofas, and in examining her domestic arrangements.</p>

<p>Bidding a lingering farewell to the sweet little island,
we again embarked and soon completed the residue of
our voyage. The foot of Loch Katrine is very romantic
and beautiful. Innumerable hills of moderate elevation
raise their grey, pointed peaks around and above
a deeply wooded glen, opening towards the south-east
and forming the outlet of the lake. The highest of
these are Ben-venue and Ben-an, rising on each side of
the pass. Both are fine mountains, something like two
thousand feet in height, with naked masses of granite
overhanging wild and woody bases. From the great
number of peaks or <i>pikes</i> which are crowded into this
narrow district, it has been called the Trosachs, or
<i>bristled region</i>. The lake is here reduced to less than
half a mile in width, sheltered on all sides from the
winds by high promontories, jutting so far into the water,
as to appear like a group of islands.</p>

<p>Towards the north-west, the eye looks up the glen
of Strathgartney, in which tradition says that the grey
charger of Fitz-James fell. The boatman gravely informed
us, that <i>his bones are to be seen to this day</i>!
Such stories, and the sketches of certain topographers,
have afforded us an infinite fund of amusement.</p>

<p>We landed at the foot of Loch Katrine, and after
walking a mile and a half reached our hotel.</p>

<h2><a name="WORSHIP" id="WORSHIP"></a>WORSHIP.</h2>

<h3>By Asa Cummings.</h3>


<p>That heart must be desolate indeed, which is a stranger
to devotion. Were it possible to remain undevout,
and at the same time not be criminal, it were still a
state of mind most earnestly to be deprecated. It is a
joyless condition, to live without God in the world; to
be unsusceptible to the attractions of his moral excellence;
to pass the time of our sojourning in a world of
trial, without ever communing with the Father of our
spirits, or voluntarily casting ourselves on an Almighty
arm for support, and breathing forth to the Author of
our being, the language of supplication and praise.</p>

<p>And how is the effect of devotion heightened by the
junction of numbers in the same service&mdash;even of the
"multitude who keep holy day!" A scene, so honorable
to Him "who inhabiteth the praises of Israel,"
so fit in itself, so congruous to man's social nature and
dependant condition, so impressive on the actors and
spectators, and so salutary in its influence,&mdash;awakened
in the "sweet singer of Israel," the most ardent longings
for the courts of the Lord, and constituted the
glowing theme of more than one of his unrivalled songs.
Nay, under the influence of that inspiration which
prompted his thoughts and guided his pen, he does not
hesitate to affirm:&mdash;"<i>The Lord loveth the gates of Zion
more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>Far from us be the thought of casting upon the
Psalmist the imputation of undervaluing himself, or of
designing to lead his fellow-men to undervalue domestic
or private worship. Every contrite heart is an
abode where God delights to dwell&mdash;a temple where
he abides and operates&mdash;a chosen habitation, where he
reveals his love and displays his grace. It is a complacent
sight to the Father of spirits, to behold one
prodigal returning, to see an individual prostrate before
him, and lifting up his cry for pardon and spiritual
strength. It is pleasing in his eyes to see a family
at their morning and evening devotions, pouring out
their souls with all the workings of pious affection, and
the various pleadings of faith. No sweeter incense
than this, ever ascends to heaven. When, therefore,
God expresses his preference for the worship of the
sanctuary, it is not the <i>quality</i> which he regards, but
the <i>degree</i>; not the <i>kind</i> of influence exerted, but the
<i>amount</i>. In the sanctuary is the concentrated devotion
of many hearts. Here are more minds to be wrought
upon; here is a wider scope for the operation of truth;
here a light is raised which is seen from afar, and attracts
the gaze of distant beholders, as the temple on
the summit of Moriah, "fretted with golden fires,"
arrested the eye of the distant traveller. Here is a
public, practical declaration to all the world, that there
is a God, and that adoration and service are his due.</p>

<p>In the sanctuary the Creator and the creature are
brought near to each other. The character and perfections
of God, his law and government, the wonders
of his providence, the riches of his grace, the duty and
destiny of man, are brought directly before the mind
by the "lively oracles." "Beholding, as in a glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same
image." Truth, enforced by the energies of the life-giving
Spirit, "is quick and powerful." God "pours
water on them that are thirsty;" and in fulfilment of
the prophetic word, "young men and maidens, old
men and children," awakened to "newness of life,"
spring up "as willows by the water-courses," and
flock to the Refuge of souls, "as doves to their windows."
A spectacle this, well pleasing to God, and
cheering to the hearts of his friends on earth&mdash;none
more so this side heaven. None produces such a commingling
of wonder, love, humility, and gratitude; none
calls forth such adoring thankfulness; none makes the
songs of the temple below so like that new song of
Moses and the Lamb, which is perpetually sung before
the throne above. Heaven is brought down to earth&mdash;eternity
takes hold on time; this world yields its usurped
throne in the hearts of men, and Jehovah reigns triumphant,
the Lord of their affections. "The power
and glory of God are seen in the sanctuary."</p>

<p>Here, too, are ample provisions to meet all future
wants&mdash;moral means to restore the wandering, to recover
the spiritually faint, to refresh and fortify their
souls to sustain the conflict with temptation, to inspire
the heart with religious joy, to nourish that spiritual
life which has dawned in their souls. Here is the
"sincere milk of the word," on which they may
"grow;" the significant ordinances, so quickening to
the affections, so invigorating to man's spiritual nature.
The Baptismal water affects the heart through the medium
of the eye, and enforces the worshipper's obligation
to abjure the world, and to be pure as Christ
is pure. The Emblematic Feast, exhibiting "Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Christ set forth crucified before his eyes,"&mdash;while it
affectingly reminds him of his lost condition as a sinner,
contains an impressive demonstration of the power
and grace of his Deliverer, "in whom we have redemption
through his blood." His faith fastens itself
on this sacrifice. He is loosed from the bondage of
sin; his "soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness."
His fellowship is with the Father, and with the Son.
He has communion with the saints. He derives new
support to his fainting faith, and goes on his pilgrimage
rejoicing.</p>

<p>The entire exercises and scenes of the house of worship&mdash;the
reading of the scriptures, the confessions,
prayers, and praises, the songs of the temple&mdash;for "as
well the singers as the players on instruments" are
there<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;the preaching of the gospel, the celebration of
the sacraments,&mdash;all combine their aid to strengthen
pious principle, holy purpose, virtuous habit, and to
render the children of God "perfect, thoroughly furnished
to every good work." The place, the day, the
multitude, the power of sympathy, all conspire to give
effect to truth, and to rouse them up to labor for God,
for their species, for eternity: all combine to render
the house of God "the gate of heaven," the image of
heaven, and a precious antepast of the enjoyments of
heaven!</p>

<h3>By Gershom F. Cox.</h3>


<p>It is a difficult task to shadow forth spirit. The best
emblems of the earth can give but faint and distant
views of its incomprehensible nature. Our own consciousness,
too, must fail to give us adequate notions
of the mysterious traits of its character. Aided by the
brightest images of earth, or the most subtle principles
of philosophy, who can bring to view any tolerably
good picture of a <span class="smcap">human soul</span>!&mdash;who can draw the
outlines of thought!&mdash;thought that is as immeasurable
as the universe!&mdash;thought that <i>could encompass</i>, with
more than the quickness of the lightning's flash, all that
God has made!&mdash;thought that gives to us, at once, the
gravity of the merest atom, the beauties and properties
of the petal of a single flower, or the structure, density,
size and weight of the worlds that border on the outskirts
of our own universe; and when it has done its
noble work, as if plumed for fresh conquests, stretches
itself far beyond the material universe, into the deep
solitudes of eternity, in quest of something more!
Who, we ask again, can give the outlines of thought?
Who can tell us of its yet hidden resources; or of a
mind like that of Newton, or of Bacon, which, after
they had taken from the arcana of nature some of her
most hidden principles, "entered the secret place of
the Most High, and lodged beneath the shadow of the
Almighty?" How much less, then, can we give just
descriptions of the <span class="smcap">Deity</span>! How can we describe Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
"who covereth himself with <span class="smcap">light</span> as with a garment,"&mdash;whom
no man hath seen, nor can see.</p>

<p>We are aware that every thing speaks of <i>a</i> God.
All nature has its language; and however dark the
alphabet, it still speaks, and speaks every where; for
there is no place where he has not "left a witness."
We acknowledge, too, that the only reason why the
deep tones of nature are not more audible, may be
found in the imbecilities or transgressions of man.
But, while the babbling brook hath its story to tell of its
Maker, and the willow that bends and sighs by its side,
and the pebble o'er which the streamlet rolls;&mdash;while
the glorious dew-drop has its power of speech&mdash;the
soft south breeze, and "the hoar-frost of heaven;"
while the deep vale may offer its chorus to the waving
corn, or to the lofty summit by its side; while often
may be heard the full notes of the angry tempest, and
of the tornado as it sweeps by us, carrying fearful desolation
in its path; although these may all speak forcibly
of the power, of the goodness, of the wisdom, of
the terrible justice of God; yet, without divine revelation,
like the inscription at Athens, they only point to
a God <span class="smcap">unknown</span>. The awful precipice, where</p>

<div class="center">
"Leaps the live thunder,"</div>


<p>in the hour of the tempest, doth but stun the intellect
of man with its overhanging and dizzy heights. And
"the sound of many waters," or "the deep, lifting up
his hands on high,"&mdash;although they may arouse every
passion of the spirit, and address it as with the voice of
God; yet, to man, these all want an interpreter. Lo!
these are but "<i>parts</i> of his ways." But what a mere
"<i>whisper</i> of the matter is heard in it, and the thunder
of his power who can understand!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Nature speaks&mdash;we repeat it&mdash;but her language, to
us, is often indefinite; like the dream of Nebuchadnezzar,
it may arouse the spirit to inquiry&mdash;agitate
every passion to consternation; but without a Daniel to
interpret her admonitions, "the thing is passed from
us." Else why this gross ignorance of the character
of God among even the enlightened, or rather civilized,
nations of antiquity? Why did not Egypt, when all
the "wisdom of the east" was concentrated in her
sons, have <i>some</i> notions of the Deity that would have
raised their minds above the serpent or crocodile, or
some insignificant article of the vegetable creation?
Why did not the savage, roaming in the freedom of his
interminable forests, have some correct views of God?
He had talked with the sun, and heard the roar of the
tempest; the evening sky in its grandeur was an everlasting
map spread out before him, and the broad lake
mirrored back to him its glories. But how confused&mdash;how
degraded were the loftiest notions of the Deity,
among the most powerful of Indian minds!</p>

<p>But I have already strayed from my purpose. I intended
only to give a specimen or two, of attempted
descriptions of the Deity, for the purpose of showing
the infinite superiority of those contained in the bible,
above every other in the world.</p>

<p>It ought, however, to be recollected, that the descriptions
we find among heathen authors, are doubtless
more or less indebted to sentiments borrowed from the
Jewish scriptures; although we believe the contrast
will show that they have passed through heathen hands.
One of the most sublime to be met with in the world,
out of the bible, was engraved in hieroglyphics upon
the temple of Neith, the Egyptian Minerva. It is as
follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am that which is, was, and shall be: no mortal
hath lifted up my veil: the offspring of my power is
the sun."</p>

<p>A similar inscription still remains at Capua, on the
temple of Isis:</p>

<p>"Thou art one, and from thee all things proceed."</p>

<p>In the above, evident traces are to be seen of the
Hebrew term <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>. Some of Homer's descriptions
have their excellencies; but they all suffer from
the fact, that he clothes the deities he describes, not
only with human passions, but with human appetites
of the most degrading character. And he never seems
more satisfied with himself than when he represents
them heated for war! "Warring gods," when placed
at the foot of Calvary, or contrasted with any just description
of the true God, is certainly a revolting idea;
and it is still worse to introduce them as does Homer,
with the shuddering thought that,</p>

<div class="center">
"Gods on gods exert <i>eternal rage</i>!"</div>

<p>And our impressions are scarcely more favorable
when he presents us with an <i>un</i>incarnate, and yet
"bleeding god," retiring from the field of battle,
"pierced with Grecian darts," "though fatal, not to
die." The following from this author is singular indeed:</p>

<div class="cpoem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of lawless force shall <i>lawless</i> MARS complain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the <i>most unjust</i>, most odious in our eyes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In human discord is thy dire delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waste of slaughter, and the rage of fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No bound, no law thy fiery temper quells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all <i>thy mother</i> in thy soul rebels!"&mdash;<i>Illiad, Book 5.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following is far less exceptionable:</p>

<div class="cpoem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And know, the Almighty is the God of gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">League all your forces then, ye powers above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join all, and try the omnipotence of Jove;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Let down our golden everlasting chain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth and main:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strive all, of mortal or immortal birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To draw, by this, the thunderer down to earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye strive in vain! If I but stretch this hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heave the gods, the ocean, and the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fix the chain to great Olympus' height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such I reign unbounded and above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such are men, and gods, compared to Jove."&mdash;Ill. b. vi.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some of the above ideas are certainly sublime, and
considering the age that produced them, they have no
superior but the bible.</p>

<p>As the <span class="smcap">koran</span> has attained considerable celebrity,
we should hardly be pardoned should we not notice it.
The passage on which the Mohammedan rests his
whole faith, for sublimity, and which is confessedly
unapproached by any thing else in the koran, is the
following:</p>

<p>"God! There is no God but he; the living, the
self-subsisting; neither slumber nor sleep seizeth him;
to him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven, and on earth.
Who is he that can intercede with him but through his
good pleasure? He knoweth that which is past, and
that which is to come. His throne is extended over
heaven and earth, and the preservation of both is to
him no burden. He is the High, the Mighty."</p>

<p>If the above passage contained a single <i>original</i>
thought, it might entitle it to higher praise than it can
now receive. But as there is no thought expressed, but
may be found in the book of Job, or among the inimitable
Psalms of David, written from sixteen hundred to
two thousand years before Mohammed, and which this
pretended prophet had before him&mdash;and as we can
hardly allow their originality of expression&mdash;the only
praise that can be bestowed upon its author is, that of
having studied the Jewish scriptures pretty closely, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
fact that is exhibited throughout his famous production.
But while we acknowledge that this is a brilliant passage,
it evidently does not surpass, nor even equal, either
of the following, selected from our own times.</p>

<div class="cpoem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Eternal Spirit! God of truth! to whom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things seem as they are. Thou who of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prophet's eye unsealed, that nightly saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While heavy sleep fell down on other men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In holy vision tranced, the future pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him, and to Judah's harp attuned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burdens which make the pagan mountains shake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Zion's cedars bow,&mdash;inspire my song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My eye unscale; me what is substance teach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shadow what, while I of things to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As past rehearsing, sing the course of time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Hold my right hand, Almighty! and me teach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strike the lyre&mdash;&mdash;to notes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which wake the echoes of Eternity."&mdash;<i>Pollok.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the above extracts there is this remarkable difference:
Mohammed, in his description of Deity, has <i>no
thought</i> that refers to a <i>moral perfection</i> of God! And
indeed gross sensuality, and a destitution of high and
spiritual views, characterize his whole work.</p>

<p>But with Pollok, the first thought is <span class="smcap">spirit</span>&mdash;a second,
<span class="smcap">truth</span>. And aside from this peculiarity, although you
turn over every leaf of the koran, we affirm that you
cannot find so sublime a conception as the following:</p>

<div class="cpoem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hold my right hand, Almighty! and me teach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strike the lyre,&mdash;&mdash;to notes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wake the echoes of eternity."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But how infinitely, both in grandeur and simplicity,
do all these fall short of the inimitable <i>original</i> of most
of these, penned by David of the Old, or Paul of the
New Testament.</p>

<p>"O, my God, take me not away in the midst of my
days: <span class="smcap">thy</span> years are throughout all generations. Of
old hast <span class="smcap">thou</span> laid the foundations of the earth, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
heavens are the work of thine hands. They shall
perish, but <span class="smcap">thou</span> shalt endure; yea, all of them shall
wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change
them, and they shall be changed. <span class="smcap">But thou art the
same, and thy years shall have no end.</span>"</p>

<p>"Who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King
of kings, and the Lord of lords; who only hath <span class="smcap">immortality</span>,
dwelling in Light which no man can approach
unto,&mdash;whom no man hath seen, nor can see!"</p>

<p>Or as in another place, "The King eternal, immortal,
invisible,&mdash;the only wise God."</p>

<p>In the above specimens, there is a grandeur and
simplicity not to be found in any merely human composition.</p>

<p>The following is very fine, from Habakkuk:</p>

<div class="cpoem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God came from Teman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Holy One from Mount Paran.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His glory covered the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his praise filled the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brightness was like the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of his hand [or side] came flashes of lightning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was only the veil of his might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him walked the pestilence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And burning coals went forth at his feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stood, and the earth was moved;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked, and caused the nations to quake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the everlasting mountains were broken in pieces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the perpetual hills did bow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His goings are from everlasting."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We scarcely know which to admire most, the above
or the following from the same author:</p>

<div class="cpoem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The mountains saw THEE and trembled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The overflowing waters passed away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep uttered his voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifted up his hands on high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun and moon stood still in their habitations.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the shining of thine arrows, (i.&nbsp;e. the lightnings,) they disappeared&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the brightness of thy glittering spear!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following paraphrastic reference may be regarded
as barren in some respects, compared with others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that might be selected from the same living fountain.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eye</span> of the Supreme Being is regarded as so
piercing as to pervade heaven, earth and hell, and the
awful depths of eternity. His <span class="smcap">countenance</span> is as the
sun shining in his strength. The wind, in its endless
whirl, is but his breath or breathing. His <span class="smcap">hand</span> is represented
so immense, that even its "hollow" will
"contain the waters of the great deep,"&mdash;and, when
"spanned," he "measures with it the whole heavens."
While "<i>sitting</i> in the circle of the heavens," the earth
is represented as the place where his feet rest. So
rapid in his motion, that "He <i>walks</i> upon the wings of
the wind." Of such awful strength, "that the earth,"
with its countless inhabitants, are "less than the dust"
that accumulates "upon the balance." At one time
"He covereth himself with <i>light</i> as with a garment,"&mdash;and
at another, "He maketh <i>darkness</i> his pavilion, and
the thick clouds of the skies."</p>

<p>These however are images all borrowed from sensible
objects, and, magnificent as they may be, they
fail of throwing upon the mind a full image of Him
who hath "no likeness in the heavens above, nor in the
earth beneath." And, besides, these glowing pictures
present to the mind none of his moral attributes. For
a description of these, we must look either to the
events of his providence, or a more particular disclosure
in the bible. And it may well astonish us, that,
after the lapse of more than three thousand years, we
may look in vain for a fuller or more perfect description
of the Divine Being, in words, than is given by <span class="smcap">Moses</span>
in that memorable moment upon Mount Sinai&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
"Whose grey tops did tremble, when God ordained their laws."</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>A description that is like the sun rising upon the
chaos that surrounded him in the Egyptian mythology,
which at that time was so gross that no object in nature
was too mean for a deity. But "in the midst of
this darkness that might be felt," God was pleased to
reveal himself in the following language, at once sufficiently
grave and impressive to afford irrefragable proof
of its high origin.</p>

<div class="hebrew"><p dir="rtl" lang="he" xml:lang="he">
ויעבור יהוה על־פניו ויקרא יהוה יהוה אל רחום
וחנון ארך אפים ורב־חסד ואמת׃ נצר חסד
לאלפים נשא עון ופשע וחטאה ונקה לא ינקה
פקד עון אבות על־בנים ועל־בני
בנים על־שלשים ועל־רבעים׃
</p></div>

<div class="translit"><ins title="Transcriber's Note: transliteration added, not present in original">~Vay'avor Adonai 'al panav vaykra Adonai Adonai El ra[h.]um ve[h.]anun erekh
apayim verav [h.]esed veemeth. Notzer [h.]esed laalafim nose 'avon vafesha ve
[h.]atah venakeh lo yinakeh poked 'avon avoth 'al banim ve'al bnei vanim 'al

<p>"And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed,
The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious,
long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear
<i>the guilty</i>; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children, and upon the children's children, unto the
third and to the fourth generation."</p>

<p>Or, as these striking appellatives of the Divine Being
might be translated, without offering any violation
to the Hebrew,&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>, the <span class="smcap">strong</span> and <span class="smcap">mighty
God</span>, the <i>merciful</i> <span class="smcap">One</span>, the <span class="smcap">gracious One</span>, the long-suffering
<span class="smcap">One</span>, the <span class="smcap">great</span> and <span class="smcap">mighty One</span>, the <span class="smcap">Bountiful
Being</span>, the <span class="smcap">True One</span>, or <span class="smcap">Truth</span>, the Preserver
of <span class="smcap">Bountifulness</span>, the <span class="smcap">Redeemer</span>, or Pardoner, the
Righteous <span class="smcap">Judge</span>, and He who <span class="smcap">visits iniquity</span>.</p>

<p>This is a remarkable description indeed to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
from one educated in the midst of Egyptian mythology;
and the awful names by which the Supreme Being
is designated, can only be accounted for, under
such circumstances, on the supposition that Moses received
them directly from the Almighty himself.</p>

<p>But to close our article. The Divine Being is nowhere
so perfectly, so interestingly described as in the
<span class="smcap">character of Christ</span>. Here <span class="smcap">love</span> is unbosomed as
it could not be by language. Here heaven drops down
to earth; and the otherwise invisible beauties of the
invisible God, are made tangible even to the eye. The
<i>arm</i> of mercy, outstretched to the sinner&mdash;the eye of
justice softened by the tear of mercy&mdash;the heart of love
beating intensely with benignity, as well as every perfection
of the divine nature; are all laid open to the
view of sinful, helpless man, and we become "eye
witness of his glorious majesty." Here the tears of
mercy may be seen dropping upon its wretched objects
of commiseration; and the most secret emotions of the
divine mind, we may behold, heaving in the bosom of
the immaculate Jesus. Here indeed "God tabernacles
and walks with man." And as a confirmation of the
glorious truth, at beholding Him, "the sun stood still in
his habitation." "The sea saw him, and was afraid."
The earth trembled at his presence, and gave back the
dead at his voice. Well indeed might one exclaim, to
behold such a personage, "<span class="smcap">My Lord and my God.</span>"</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FRENCH_REVOLUTION" id="THE_FRENCH_REVOLUTION"></a>THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.</h2>

<h3>By Charles S. Daveis.</h3>


<p>Never&mdash;since the period that Cæsar conquered Gaul,
when the inhabitants enjoyed a barbarian license under
their native chiefs and druids, had the voice of liberty
been heard in France, till the 14th of July, 1789. Never
before did such a note of exultation spread over the
vine-covered hills,&mdash;and echo among the beautiful valleys,
of that fair country. Never perhaps before was
there such a burden lifted from the minds of men. In
the unwonted consciousness of power, they seemed to
tread a new earth. In the intoxication of triumph they
burst from the bonds of morality and humanity. So
very singular, and strange, indeed, was the position in
which the people of France were placed by the revolution,
that their vernacular language was found deficient
in the appropriate phraseology of freedom; and they
were obliged to resort to a foreign idiom, and to the
customs of other climes, and the usages of other nations,
and to ransack the regions of fancy and invention,
for the vocabulary, as well as the drapery, of their
new republic.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that the revolution in France, beginning
in fact, with the destruction of the Bastile,
should end in the re-establishment of despotism. It
was a revolution indeed not more remarkable for the
original character of its cause, than its catastrophe;
for the astonishing contrast it exhibits between the
splendor of its talents and the atrocity of its crimes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
for the reverence which it professed for antiquity, and
the mischief it produced to posterity; for adopting the
most enormous maxims, and enforcing them by the
most audacious means; for the use which it made of
its own freedom to enslave other nations to its law, for
erecting the empire of Rome upon the democracy of
Athens, for the adoption of a model of colossal grandeur,
and establishing the most tremendous system of
policy, that ever convulsed human kind:&mdash;a revolution,
conspicuous also for the sudden appearance of a race
of men springing up from the earth, as though it had
been sown with dragons' teeth, and its monstrous fruits
produced with hydras' heads and tigers' hearts;&mdash;resounding,
together, with the tribune, and the guillotine;&mdash;not
merely remarkable for tearing the priest from
the altar, but for rasing the altar likewise to the ground;
and distinguished for the successive destruction of some
of the most ancient thrones and crowns in Europe;&mdash;for
the ignominious death of the last in a royal line of
seventy sovereigns, who, at any former period of the
monarchy, would have been blessed as the father of
his people, and canonized as the true descendant of St.
Louis,&mdash;and the most affecting example on record of
an anointed queen, not more famed for her charms
than for her sorrows,&mdash;her errors more than atoned by
her sufferings, perishing without a tear, in a land of
ancient renown for chivalry, upon the scaffold! The
revolution in France was a scene at which sensibility
sinks. It seemed to extinguish the hopes of its friends
in the blood of its martyrs; and it was hardly relieved
by the virtues of its purest patriot, educated in the
schools of America, banished from the air of France,
and doomed to breathe the dungeons of despotism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>To what are we indebted again for our escape from
that wild turmoil, which involved the elements of society
and government in Europe with an overwhelming
violence? Why was it, that while the storm, that
shook the continent abroad, beat against our iron-bound
shore, its fury was expended at our feet; and we heard
it howl along our agitated coast and die away at a distance?
Why did we enjoy a light, like the children
of Israel, in our dwellings, while Egyptian darkness
brooded around? Why, in this universal chaos, had
we such reason to congratulate ourselves on the good
providence of God, in ordaining us to be a world by
ourselves?&mdash;It was certainly not, that we did not enter
into the cause of liberty in France with enthusiasm;
for our hearts were in it as warmly as they were in our
own. Our sympathy was with it as long as it could
be sustained; our regret pursued it in dishonor,&mdash;and
our affection followed it into misfortune. We lamented
to see, that all the results of that amazing movement
of the human mind, contemplating the happiness of
millions, and looking to the improvement of ages, should
follow the fortune of foreign war; and that they should
centre in a single individual, carried away into captivity,
and doomed to end his days upon a solitary rock.
We grieved to behold the beautiful and brilliant star of
the French Revolution sink at last into mid-ocean, the
mere meteor of military glory.&mdash;Feeling all the disappointment
of its friends, we cannot but contrast it with
the deep repose, which our own illustrious and honored
patriots enjoy, in the land which gave them birth, beneath
the mighty shadows of our happy political revolution.</p>

<p>Although, as Americans, we cease to cling to the
cause of revolutionary liberty in France with the lingering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
fondness of early affection, we continue to follow
its dying light, as though we could not believe it
had entirely sunk in darkness and despair. If it be not
possible to regard it uninfluenced by its unfortunate
termination, if we can borrow nothing from its origin to
relieve its mournful catastrophe, it behoves us still to
embalm the wounds of liberty with its healing spirit,
and it concerns us also, that all its sacrifices and services
for the sake of man should not have perished with
its victims. The vices of the ancient government rendered
it unfit for the happiness of France, without essential
alterations; and while we reflect with pain upon
the results of the revolution, we must bear in mind that
they were the excesses of men like ourselves, transported
by hopes excited by our example, and exalted by a
more ardent temper, untrained by the same favorable
habits and beneficial institutions;&mdash;and although its
transient violence may shock and repel our sympathy,
it ought not to disgust us with its principles, or to alienate
our attachment from its rational objects. Let us
not fail to perceive, as we shall, if we are attentive to
the facts, that what was good was in the cause; and
what was evil was the effect of that long oppression by
which it was corrupted. In this wonderful dispensation
to mankind we may not perhaps pretend to scan the
ways of providence; yet in common with the christian
world we cannot fail to behold the dealing of a divine
and overruling hand. Where the seed of liberty has
been sown, and watered with the blood, as well as
tears, of patriots, that seed is yet <i>in</i> the earth; and
whether it spring up before our eyes or not, it may be
the will of Him, to whom no eye is raised in vain, that
nothing shall be lost!</p>

<h2><a name="MRS_SYKES" id="MRS_SYKES"></a>MRS. SYKES.</h2>

<h3>By Nathaniel Deering.</h3>


<p>One dark, stormy night in the summer of &mdash;&mdash; finding
my system had lost much of its <i>humidum radicale</i>,
or radical moisture, in truth a very alarming premonitory,
I directed Mrs. Tonic in preparing my warm
<i>aqua fontana</i> to infuse a <i>quantum sufficit</i> of Hollands;
of which having taken a somewhat copious draught, I
sought my cubiculum. Let no one imagine however,
that I give the least countenance to the free use of alcoholic
mixtures. They are undoubtedly poisonous, and
like other poisons, which hold a high rank in our pharmacopeia,
it is only when taken under the direction of
those deemed cunning in our art, that they exert a healing
power, and as one Shakspeare happily expresses it,
"ascend me to the brain." Now as the radical moisture
is essential to vitality and as this moisture is promoted
in a wonderful degree by potations of Hollands, we
of the Faculty hold with Horatius Flaccus "<i>omnes eodem
cogimur</i>"&mdash;we may all <i>cogue</i> it. But to return to
my <i>narratio</i> or story as it may be called. I had hardly
"steep'd my senses in forgetfulness" as some one
quaintly says, when I was effectually aroused by a loud
knocking at the window. The blows were so heavy
and frequent that Mrs. Tonic though somewhat unadorned,
it being her hour for retiring, yet fearful of
fractured glass, hurried to the door. I might here mention,
in order to show the reason of Mrs. Tonic's fears,
that my parlor front-window had been lately beautified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
with an enlarged sash containing not seven by nine, the
size generally used, but eight by ten&mdash;panes certainly
of a rare and costly size and which Mrs. Tonic had the
honor of introducing. The cause of this unseasonable
disturbance proved to be a messenger from Deacon
Sykes stating that good Mrs. Sykes was alarmingly ill
and desiring my immediate attendance. Now in the
whole range of my practice there was no one whose
call was sooner heeded than Mrs. Sykes's; for besides
being an ailing woman and of course a profitable patient,
she had much influence in our village as the
wife of Deacon Sykes. But I must confess that on
this occasion I did feel an unwillingness to resume my
habiliments, that night as I before remarked, being uncommonly
stormy and myself feeling sensibly the effects
of the sudorific I had just taken. Still I should
willingly have exposed myself had not Mrs. Tonic
gathered from the messenger that it was only a return
of Mrs. Sykes's old complaint, that excruciating pain,
the colic; for Mrs. Sykes was flatulent. As the medicine
I had hitherto prescribed for her in such aliments
had been wonderfully blessed, I directed Mrs. Tonic to
bring my saddle-bags, from which having prepared a
somewhat smart dose of <i>tinct. rhei.</i> with <i>carb. soda</i>, I
gave it to the messenger bidding him return with all
speed. In the belief that this would prove efficacious,
I again turned to woo the not reluctant Somnus, but
scarcely had an hour elapsed when I was again alarmed
by repeated blows first at the door and then at the
window. In a moment I sat bolt upright, in which attitude
I was soon imitated by Mrs. Tonic, on hearing
the crash of one of her eight by tens. Through the
aperture I now distinctly recognized the voice of Sam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Saunders, who had hired with the Deacon, stating that
good Mrs. Sykes was absolutely <i>in extremis</i>, or as Sam
himself expressed it, "at her last gasp." On hearing
this, you may be assured I was not long <i>in naturalibus</i>;
but drawing on my nether integuments, I departed despite
the remonstrances of Mrs. Tonic, without my
wrapper and without any thing in fact except a renewed
draught of my <i>philo humidum radicale</i>. My journey
to the Deacon's was made with such an accelerated
movement that it was accomplished as it were <i>per
saltum</i>. This was owing to my great anxiety about
Mrs. Sykes, though possibly in a small degree I might
have dreaded an obstruction of the pores in my own
person. Howbeit, on arriving at the Deacon's, I saw
at once that she was beyond the healing art. There
lay all that remained of Mrs. Sykes&mdash;the <i>disjecta membra</i>,
the <i>fragmenta</i>&mdash;the casket! But the gem, the
<i>mens divinior</i> was gone and forever. There she lay,
regardless of the elongated visage of Deacon Sykes on
the one side, and of the no less elongated visage of the
widow Dobble on the other side, who had been some
time visiting there, and who now hung over her departed
friend in an agony of woe. "Doctor," cried the
Deacon, "is there no hope?" "Is there no hope?"
echoed the widow Dobble. I grasped the wrist of Mrs.
Sykes, but pulsation had ceased; the eye was glazed
and the countenance livid. "<i>A caput mortuum</i>, Deacon!
<i>defuncta!</i> the wick of vitality is snuffed out."
The bereaved husband groaned deeply; the widow
Dobble groaned an octave higher.</p>

<p>On my way home my mind was much exercised
with this sudden and mysterious dispensation. Had
Sam Saunders blundered in his statement of her complaint?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Had I myself&mdash;good Heavens! it could'nt be
possible! I opened my bags&mdash;<i>horresco referens!</i> it
was but too palpable! Owing either to the agitation
of the moment when so suddenly awakened, or to the
deep solicitude of Mrs. Tonic, who, in preparing my
<i>philo humidum radicale</i>, had infused an undue portion
of the Hollands&mdash;to one of these the lamented Mrs.
Sykes might charge her untimely exit; for there was
the vial of <i>tinct. rhei.</i> full to the stopple, while the vial
marked "laudanum," was as dry as a throat in fever.
I hesitate not to record that at this discovery, I lost
some of that self-possession which has ever been characteristic
of the Tonics. I was not only standing on
the brow of a precipice, but my centre of gravity
seemed a little beyond it. There were rivals in the
vicinity jealous of my rising reputation. The sudden
death might cause a <i>post mortem</i> examination, and the
result would be as fatal to me as was the laudanum to
Mrs. Sykes. A thought, occurring, doubtless through
a special Providence, suddenly relieved my mind. At
break of day I retraced my footsteps to the chamber
of the deceased. Accompanied by the Deacon I approached
to gaze upon the corpse; when, suddenly
starting back, I placed one hand upon my olfactories
and grasping with the other the alarmed mourner, I
hurried towards the door. "In the name of heaven!"
cried the Deacon, "what is the matter?" "The matter!"
I replied, "the matter! Deacon, listen. In all
cases of mortality where the radical moisture has not
been lessened by long disease, putrefaction commences
on the cessation of the organic functions and a <i>miasma</i>
fatal to the living is in a moment generated.
This is the case even in cold weather, and it being now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
July, I cannot answer for your own life if the burial be
deferred; the last sad offices must be at once attended
to." Deacon Sykes consented. Not, he remarked, on
his own account, for, as to himself, life had lost its
charms, but there were others near on whom many
were dependent, and he could not think of gratifying
his own feelings at their expense&mdash;sufficient, says he,
for the day is the evil thereof. I hardly need add,
that, when my advice to the Deacon got wind, the
neighbors with one accord rallied to assist in preparing
Mrs. Sykes for her last home; and their labors
were not a little quickened by the fumes of tar and
vinegar which I directed to be burnt on this melancholy
occasion. Much as I cherished Mrs. Sykes, still I
confess that my feelings were much akin to those
called pleasurable, when I heard the rattle of those terrene
particles which covered at the same time my lamented
friend and my professional lapsus.</p>

<p>But after all, as I sat meditating on the ups and
downs of life during the evening of the funeral, the
question arose in my mind, is all safe? May not
some unfledged Galens remove the body for the purpose
of dissection?&mdash;Worse than all, may not some
malignant rival have already meditated a similar expedition?
The more I reflected on this matter and its
probable consequences, the more my fears increased,
till at last they became too great for my frail tenement.
There was at this period a boarder in my family, one
Job Sparrow, who having spent about thirty years of his
pilgrimage in the "singing of anthems," concluded at
length to devote the residue thereof to the study of the
human frame, to which he was the more inclined, probably,
as he could have the benefit of my deep investigations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
His outward man, though somewhat ungainly,
was exceedingly muscular, and he had a firmness
of nerve which would make him willingly engage in
any enterprise that would aid him in his calling. Conducting
him to my sanctum or study, a retired chamber
in my domicil, "Job," I remarked, "I have long
noticed your engagedness in the healing art, and I have
lamented my inability of late to further your progress
in the study of anatomy from the difficulty of procuring
subjects. An opportunity, however, is at length
afforded, and I shall not fail to embrace it though at
the sacrifice of my best feelings. The subject I mean,
is the lamented Mrs. Sykes. Bring her remains at
night to this chamber, and I with my venerable friend
Dr. Grizzle will exhibit what, though often described,
are seldom visible, those wonderful absorbents, the <i>lacteals</i>.&mdash;It
is only in very recent subjects, my dear
Job, that it is possible to point them out." My pupil
grinned complacently at this manifestation of kindly
feelings towards him in one so much his superior, and
hastened to prepare himself for the expedition. It was
about nine of the clock when the venerable Dr. Grizzle,
whom I had notified of my intended operations
through Job, came stealthily in. Dr. Grizzle, though
from his appearance one would conclude that he was
about to "shuffle off this mortal coil," was a <i>rara avis</i>
as to his knowledge of the corporeal functions. There
were certain gainsayers, indeed, who asserted that his
intellectual candle was just glimmering in its socket;
but it will show to a demonstration how little such statements
are to be regarded when I assert that the like
slanders had been thrown out touching my own person.
The profound Grizzle, above such malignant feelings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
always coincided with my own opinion, both as to the
nature of the disease we were called to counteract,
and as to the mode of treatment; and so highly did I
value him, that he was the only one whom I called to
a consultation when that course was deemed expedient.
We had prepared our instruments and were refreshing
our minds with the pages of Chesselden, a luminous
writer, when to my great satisfaction the signal of my
pupil was heard below. Hitherto our labors seemed
to have been blest; but a difficulty occurred in this
stage of our progress which threatened not only to render
these labors useless, but to retard, if I may so say,
the advance of anatomical science. It was this; the
stairway was uncommonly narrow, and the lamented
Mrs. Sykes was uncommonly large. As it was impossible,
then, for Job to pass up at the same time with
the defunct, it was settled after mature deliberation,
that he and myself, should occupy a post at each extreme,
while Grizzle assisted near the <i>lumbar</i> region.
"Now," cried Job, "heave together;" but the words
were hardly uttered, when a shreak from Grizzle, paralized
our exertions. Our muscular efforts had wedged
my venerable friend so completely between Mrs.
Sykes and the wall, that his lungs wheezed like a pair
of decayed bellows; and had it not been for the Herculean
strength of Job, who rushed as it were <i>in medias
res</i>, the number of the dead would have equalled
that of the living. At length, after repeated trials, we
effected, as I facetiously remarked, our "passage of
the Alps;" an historical allusion which tended much
to the divertisement of Grizzle and obliterated in no
small measure, the memory of his recent peril. And
now, having directed Job to go down and secure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
door, Grizzle and myself advanced to remove the bandages
that confined her arms, previous to dissection.
But scarcely was the work accomplished when a sepulchral
groan burst from the defunct, the eyes glared,
and the loosened arm was slowly lifted from the body.
That I am not of that class who can be charged with
any thing like timidity, is, I think well proved by my
consenting to act for several years as regimental surgeon
in our militia, a post undoubtedly of danger. But
I must concede that at this unexpected movement, both
Grizzle and myself were somewhat agitated. From
the table to the stair-way, we leaped, as it were by instinct,
and with a velocity at which even now I greatly
marvel. This sudden evidence of vitality in my lamented
friend, or I might say rather an unwillingness
to be found alone with her in such a peculiar situation,
also induced me to prevent if possible the retreat of
Grizzle, and I fastened with some degree of violence
upon his projecting queue. It was fortunate, in so far
as regarded Grizzle, that art in this instance had supplanted
nature. His wig, of which the queue formed
no inconsiderable portion, was all that my hand retained.
Had it been otherwise, such was the tenacity of
my grasp on the one hand, and such his momentum on
the other, that Grizzle must have left the natural ornament
of his cerebrum, while I, though unjustly, must
have been charged with imitating our heathenish Aborigines.
As it was, his bald pate shot out from beneath
it with the velocity of a discharged ball; nor was the
similitude to that engine of carnage at all lessened
when I heard its rebounds upon the stairs. How long
I remained overwhelmed by the wonderful scenes
which I had just witnessed, I cannot tell; but on recovering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
I found that Mrs. Sykes had been removed
to my best chamber, and Job and Mrs. Tonic both busily
engaged about her person. They had, as I afterwards
ascertained, by bathing her feet and rubbing her
with hot flannels, wrought a change almost miraculous;
and the effects of the laudanum having happily subsided
she appeared, when I entered, as in her pristine
state. At that moment they were about administering
a composing draught, which undoubtedly she needed,
having received several severe contusions on the stairway
in our endeavors to extricate Grizzle. But rushing
forward, I exclaimed, "thanks to Heaven that I again
see that cherished face! thanks that I have been the instrument
under Providence of restoring to society its
brightest ornament! Be composed, my dear Mrs.
Sykes, ask no questions to night, unless you would
frustrate all my labors." Then presenting to her lips
an opiate, in a short time I had the satisfaction of seeing
her sink into a tranquil slumber.</p>

<p>As I considered it all important that the matter
should be kept a profound secret till I had arranged
my plans; and as Mrs. Tonic had in a remarkable degree
that propensity which distinguishes woman&mdash;I was
under the necessity of making her privy to the whole
transaction; trusting that the probable ruin to my reputation
consequent on an exposure would effectually
bridle her unruly member. My venerable friend too,
I invited for a few days to my own mansion lest the
bruises he received during his <i>exodus</i> from the dissecting
room might have deprived him of his customary
caution. The last and most difficult step was to prepare
the mind of Mrs. Sykes, who was yet <i>in nubibus</i>
as to her new location. With great caution I gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
unfolded the strange event that had just transpired,&mdash;her
sudden apparent death, the alarm of the village
touching the <i>miasma</i>, and the consequent sudden interment.
'Your exit, my dear Mrs. Sykes,' I continued,
'seemed like a dream&mdash;I could not realize it. Such
an irreparable loss! I thought of all the remedies that
had been applied in such cases. Had any thing been
omitted that had a tendency to increase the circulation
of the radical fluid! There was the Galvanic battery,&mdash;it
had been entirely overlooked, and yet what wonders
it had performed! No sooner had this occurred
to my mind than I was impressed with the conviction
that you were to revisit this mundane sphere, and that
I was the chosen instrument to enkindle the vital spark.
No time was lost in obeying this mysterious impulse.
The grave was opened, the battery was applied <i>secundem
artem</i>&mdash;and the result is the restoration to society
of our beloved Mrs. Sykes.' In proportion to her horror
at the idea, that she must have rested from her labors
but for my skill, was her gratitude for this timely
rescue. She fell on my neck and clung like one demented,
till a gathering frown on the face of my spouse
warned me of the necessity of repelling her embraces.
Mrs. Sykes was now desirous of returning immediately
home, to restore as it were to life her bereaved consort,
who was no doubt mourning at his desolation, and
refusing to be comforted. But here I felt it my duty
to interpose. 'My dear Mrs. Sykes,' said I, 'your return
at this moment would overwhelm him. The sudden
change from the lowest depths of woe to a state of
ecstacy, would consign him to the tenement you have
just quitted. No! this extraordinary Providence must be
gradually unfolded.' She yielded at last to my sage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
councils and consented to wait till the violence of his
grief had somewhat abated, and his mind had become
sufficiently tranquil to hear that tale which I was cautiously
to relate. On the following day however, her
anxiety to return had risen to a high pitch, and truly
by evening it was beyond my control. She was firm
in the belief that I could make the disclosure without
essential injury to the Deacon; 'besides,' as she remarked,
'there was no knowing how much waste there
had been in the kitchen.' It was settled at last that I
should immediately walk over to the Deacon's, and by
a judicious train of reflection, for which I was admirably
fitted, prepare the way for this joyous meeting.
When I arrived at the house of mourning, though perhaps
the last person in the world entitled to the name
of evesdropper, yet as my eye was somewhat askance
as I passed the window, I observed a spectacle that for
a time arrested my footsteps. There sat the Deacon,
recounting probably the virtues of the deceased partner,
and there, not far apart, sat the widow Dobble
sympathizing in his sorrows. It struck me that Deacon
Sykes was not ungrateful for her consolatory efforts;
for he took her hand with a gentle pressure
and held it to his bosom. Perhaps it was the unusual
mode of dress now exhibited by the widow Dobble,
that led him to this act; for she was decked out in Mrs.
Sykes's best frilled cap, and such is the waywardness
of fancy, he might for the moment have imagined that
his help-mate was beside him. Be that as it may,
while I was thus complacently regarding this interchange
of friendly feelings, the cry of '<i>you vile hussy</i>'
suddenly rang in my very ear, and the next instant,
the door having been burst open, who should stand before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the astonished couple but the veritable Mrs. Sykes.
The Deacon leaped as if touched in the <i>pericardium</i>,
and essayed to gain the door; but in his transit his
knees denied their office, and he sank gibbering as his
hand was upon the latch. As to the terrified widow
Dobble, I might say with Virgilius, <i>steteruntque comae</i>,
her <i>combs</i> stood up; for the frilled cap was displaced
with no little violence, and with an agonizing shriek
she fell, apparently <i>in articulo mortis</i>, on the body of
the Deacon. What a lamentable scene! and all in
consequence of the rashness and imprudence of Mrs.
Sykes. No sooner had I left my own domicil than
Mrs. Sykes, regardless of my admonitions, resolved on
following my steps, and was actually peeping over my
shoulder at the moment the Deacon's hand came in
contact with the widow Dobble's. It was truly fortunate
for all concerned that a distinguished member of
the faculty was near at this dreadful crisis. In ordinary
hands nothing could have prevented a quietus.
Their spirits were taking wing, and it was only by extraordinary
skill that I effected what lawyer Snoodles
said was a complete 'stoppage <i>in transitu</i>.' I regret
to state that this was my last visit to Deacon Sykes's.
Unmindful of my services in resuscitating Mrs. Sykes,
he remarked that my neglect to prepare him for the
exceeding joy that was in store, had so far shattered
his nervous system that his usefulness was over; and
in fine, had built up between us a wall of separation
not to be broken down. I always opined, however,
and of this opinion was Mrs. Tonic, that the Deacon's
coldness arose in part from an incipient warmth for
Mrs. Dobble, which was thus checked in its first stages.
It was even hinted that on her departure, which took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
place immediately, he manifested less of resignation
than at the burial of Mrs. Sykes. The coldness of the
widow Dobble towards me, certainly unmerited, was
also no less apparent, till I brought about what I had
much at heart, viz: a match between her and Major
Popkin. He was a discreet, forehanded man, a Representative
to our General Court, and kept the Variety
Store in that part of our town that was named in honor
of him, 'Popkins's Corner.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>I am alarmed at the changes which are taking place in
society. While many are lauding the <i>spirit of the age</i>
and holding up to my gaze the picture of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fourth-coming'">forth-coming</ins>
improvements&mdash;opening broad and charming vistas
into the almost <i>present future</i> of mental and moral
perfection, I cannot help casting a lingering look upon
the past. Time was when old age and infancy, manhood
and youth, walked the path of life together;
when the strength of young limbs aided the feebleness
of the old, and the joyousness of youth enlivened the
gravity of age. But the son has now left the father
to totter on alone, and the daughter has outstripped the
mother in the race. Beauty and strength have separated
from decrepitude and weakness. The vine has
uncoiled from its natural support, and the ivy has
ceased to entwine the oak.</p>

<p>There is an increasing disposition on the part of the
young and the old to classify their pleasures according
to their age. Those pastimes which used to be enjoyed
by both together, are now separated. This is an
evil of too serious a character to pass unfelt, unlamented
or unrebuked. It is easy to refer back to days
when parents were more happy with their children,
and children more honorable and useful to parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
than at present. It is not long since the old and the
young were to be seen together in the blithesome dance
and the merry play. And why this change? Why
do we find that, within a few years, the old have abandoned
amusements to the young? Is it that they think
their children can profit more by their amusements
than if they were present? If this be the impression
it is to be regretted. No course could they possibly
adopt so injurious to the character of their children.
For youth need the direction and the advice of age,
and age requires the exhilaration and cheerfulness of
youth. How many lonely evenings would be enlivened&mdash;how
many dark visions of the future would be
dissipated, and how many hours of gloom and despondency
would be put to flight, if fathers would keep
pace with their sons, and mothers with their daughters,
in the innocent pleasures of life. Here, as it appears
to me, is the grand secret of happiness for the young
and the old. For the old, who are too apt to dwell on
the glories of the past and to see nothing that is lovely
in the present; and for the young, who throw too
strong and gaudy a light upon the present and the future.
Nature did not so intend it. So long as there is
life, she intended we should innocently enjoy it. And
the barrier which has, by some unaccountable mishap,
been thrown between the young and the old is, therefore,
greatly to be lamented. But how shall it be
removed? How shall we get back again to the good
old times of the merry husking, the joyous dance, the
happy commingling in the same company, of the priest
and his deacon, the father and his child, the husband
and his wife?</p>

<p>It would not be difficult to trace directly to the discontinuance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of the practice of joining with the young
in their amusements, the great increase of youthful
dissipation of every description. By being removed
from the advice, restraint and example of the old and
experienced, they have, by degrees, fallen into usages
which were almost unknown in years gone by. When
accompanied by parents, the hours of pleasure were
seasonable. Daughters were under the inspection of
mothers, and sons were guided by the wisdom of fathers.
Homes were happier, the community more virtuous,
and the world at large a gainer by such judicious
customs. We now hear the complaint that sons have
gone astray, that daughters have behaved indiscreetly,
and that families have been disgraced. But can there
be a doubt, if the practice were general of accompanying
our children in those pastimes in which they ought
to be reasonably indulged, that many of these evils
would be prevented? Here then must begin the reform.
Complain not that your son is out late, if you might
have been with him to bring him to your fire-side at a
seasonable hour. Complain not that your daughter
has formed an unsuitable or untimely connexion, if a
mother's care might have avoided the evil. Youth
<i>will</i> go astray without the protection of age. And it is
a crying sin that these old-fashioned moral restraints
have been removed. What, I ask, can be your object
in thus leaving your children to their own direction?
Do they love you the better for it? Are their manners
more agreeable&mdash;their conduct more respectful while
at home? Is not rather the reverse of this the case?
Do they not give you more trouble at home? Are
they not every day incurring new and useless expenses
in consequence of allowing them to legislate and plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
for themselves? Rashness is the characteristic of
youth. But allowing them to be capable of governing
themselves, you are a great loser by drawing this
strong division line between their pleasures and your
own. Your own years are less in number and in happiness.
Your children are dead to you, though alive
to themselves. Your sympathies are not linked with
theirs step by step in life; and thus, although surrounded
by children, you go childless, unhappy and gloomy
to the grave. Reform then, I say, reform at once.
Annihilate this classification of junior and senior pleasures.
Join with your children in the dance, the song
and the play. Enjoy with them every harmless pleasure
and sport of life. Encompass yourself as often as
possible with the gay faces of the young. Teach them
by example, to be happy like rational beings, and to
enjoy life without abusing it. Let the ripe fruit be seen
with the green&mdash;the blossom with the bud&mdash;the green
with the fading leaf and the vine with its natural support:</p>

<h2><a name="AUTUMNAL_DAYS" id="AUTUMNAL_DAYS"></a>AUTUMNAL DAYS.</h2>

<h3>By P. H. Greenleaf.</h3>

<div class="cpoem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The melancholy days are come&mdash;the saddest of the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wailing winds and naked woods, and meadows brown and sear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heap'd in the hollows of the grove, the summer leaves lie dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rustle to the eddying wind, and to the rabbit's tread:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrubs the jay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the wood-top calls the crow, thro' all the gloomy day."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Stern and forbidding as are the general features of
our northern climate&mdash;cold and chilling as the gay
Southron may deem, even the very air we breathe,&mdash;we
have still some characteristics of climate peculiar to
ourselves, and none the less pleasing to us from this
fact. Our hearts must indeed be as hard and as cold
as the very granite of our craggy shores, did they not
glow with delight in the possession of that, (be it what
it may) which is peculiar to and markedly characteristic
of our native home. And of all these peculiarities
not one is so delightful&mdash;not one finds us so rich
in New England feeling, as that beautiful season called
the Indian Summer. It occurs in October, and is
characterized by a soft, hazy atmosphere&mdash;by those
quiet, and balmy days, which seem so like the last
whisperings of a Spring morning. The appearance of
the landscape is like any thing, but the fresh and lively
scenery of Spring; and yet the delicious softness of
the atmosphere is so like it, that it brings back fresh to
the mind all the beautiful associations connected with
a vernal day. Our forests too, at this season are, for
a brief space, clothed in the most gorgeous and magnificent
array; their brilliant and changing hues, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the magnificence of their whole appearance, almost
give their rich and mellow tint to the atmosphere itself;
and render this period unrivalled in beauty, and unequalled
in the more equable climes of our western
neighbors. The calm sobriety of the scenery&mdash;the
splendid variety of the forest coloring, from deep scarlet
to russet gray, and the quiet and dreamy expression of
the autumnal atmosphere make a deeper impression on
the mind than all the verdant promises of spring, or
the luxuriant possession of summer. The aspen birch
in its pallid white&mdash;the walnut in its deep yellow&mdash;the
brilliant maple in its scarlet drapery&mdash;and the magical
colors of the whole vegetable world, from the aster by
the brook to the vine on the trellis, combine to render
the autumnal scenery of New-England the most splendid
and magnificent in the world.</p>

<p>But we cannot forget, if we would, that this beautiful
magnificence of the forests is but the livery of
death; and the changing hues of the leaves, beautiful
though they are, still are but indications of the sure,
but gradual progress of decay.</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Lightly falls the foot of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whene'er he treads on flowers:'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and though he has breathed beauty on the clustered
trees of the forest&mdash;it is to them the breath of the Sirocco.</p>

<p>We have in the wasting consumption a parallel to
this splendid decay of the leaves and flowers of Summer.
Day by day we see its victim with the seal of death
upon him&mdash;failing and decaying in strength&mdash;increasing
in beauty. While the brilliant and intellectual
glances of the eye speak, in language too plain for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
sceptic's denial, the immortality of the soul. The
changing and brilliant hues of the forest trees give to
us the most lively type of the frailty of beauty and the
brevity of human existence, while their death and burial
during the winter and their resurrection in the springtime,
are almost an assured pledge of our own immortality
and resurrection to an eternity.</p>

<p>Truly 'the melancholy days are come'&mdash;Death annually
lifts up his solemn hymn, and the rustling of the
dying leaves and the certainty of their speedy death
afford to us all 'eloquent teachings.' The gay and
exhilarating spring has long since passed away&mdash;the
genial and joyous warmth of summer is no more; and
the grateful abundance and varied scenes of Autumn
are about yielding to the inclemency of hoary winter.
The gay variety of nature has at length departed&mdash;the
countless throng of the gaudy flowerets of summer are
all returned to their native dust&mdash;the light of the sun
himself is often veiled; and the bright livery of earth
is hidden from our sight by the gray mantle of the
iron-bound surface, or the unbroken whiteness of a
snowy covering. Reading thus the language of decay
written by the finger of God upon all the works of nature&mdash;reminded
too of the rapid flight of time by the
ceaseless revolution of seasons, we naturally turn our
thoughts from the contemplation of external objects to
that of the soul, and of unseen worlds. The appearances
of other seasons lead our thoughts to the world we
inhabit, and by the variety of objects presented to our
view rather confine them to sensible things, and matters
immediately connected with them. But the buried
flowers and the eddying leaves of this season teach us
nobler lessons; and the mind expands, while it loses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
itself in the infinity of being; and the gloom of the
natural world shows us the splendors of other worlds,
and other states of being;</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'As darkness shows us worlds of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We never saw by day.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They tell us, that in the magnificent system of the
government of God there exists no evil; and the mighty
resurrections annually accomplished in the multitude
of by gone years assure us, that the gloom of the night
is but the prelude to the brightness of the day&mdash;that
the funeral pall of autumnal and wintry days is the
harbinger of a glorious, joyous and life-giving spring;
and to that man the gates of the dark valley of the
shadow of death are designed as the crystal portals of
an eternity of bliss.</p>

<p>'Of the innumerable eyes, that open upon nature,
none but those of man, see its author and its end.'
This solemn privilege is the birth-right of the beings of
immortality&mdash;of those, who perish not in time, but were
formed, in some greater hour, to be companions in
eternity. The mighty Being, who watches the revolutions
of the material world, opens in this manner to our
eyes the laws of his government; and tells us, that it
is not the momentary state, but the final issue, which
is to disclose its eternal design. Indeed the whole volume
of nature is a natural revelation to man, often
overlooked&mdash;often misused&mdash;seldom understood&mdash;but
plain and solemn in its language, and full of the wisdom,
justice and mercy of its author.</p>

<p>While, then, all inferior nature shrinks instinctively
from the winds of Autumn and the storms of winter, to
the high intellect of man they teach ennobling lessons.
To him the inclemency of winter is no less eloquent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
than the abundance of Autumn, or the joyous promise
of Spring. He knows, that the fair and beautiful of
nature now buried in an icy covering, have still a principle
of life within them; and that the gay tendrils of
the vine and the blushing buds of the rose will soon
be put forth in the breath of summer. The stiffened
earth, he knows, will soon send forth her children in
renewed beauty, and he believes, that he himself, leaving
the chrysalis form of earthly clay will wing his
flight in the regions of eternity.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_VILLAGE_PRIZE" id="THE_VILLAGE_PRIZE"></a>THE VILLAGE PRIZE.</h2>

<h3>By Joseph Ingraham.</h3>


<p>In one of the loveliest villages of old Virginia there
lived, in the year 175&ndash; and odd, an old man, whose
daughter was declared, by universal consent, to be the
loveliest maiden in all the country round. The veteran,
in his youth, had been athletic and muscular above
all his fellows; and his breast, where he always wore
them, could show the adornment of three medals, received
for his victories in gymnastic feats when a young
man. His daughter was now eighteen, and had been
sought in marriage by many suitors. One brought
wealth&mdash;another, a fine person&mdash;another, industry&mdash;another,
military talents&mdash;another this, and another
that. But they were all refused by the old man, who
became at last a by-word for his obstinacy among the
young men of the village and neighborhood. At length,
the nineteenth birthday of Annette, his charming daughter,
who was as amiable and modest as she was beautiful,
arrived. The morning of that day, her father invited
all the youth of the country to a hay-making frolic.
Seventeen handsome and industrious young men assembled.
They came not only to make hay, but also
to make love to the fair Annette. In three hours they
had filled the father's barns with the newly dried grass,
and their own hearts with love. Annette, by her father's
command, had brought them malt liquor of her
own brewing, which she presented to each enamored
swain with her own fair hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now my boys," said the old keeper of the jewel
they all coveted, as leaning on their pitch-forks they
assembled around his door in the cool of the evening&mdash;"Now
my lads, you have nearly all of you made proposals
for my Annette. Now you see, I don't care
any thing about money nor talents, book larning nor
soldier larning&mdash;I can do as well by my gal as any
man in the county. But I want her to marry a man
of my own grit. Now, you know, or ought to know,
when I was a youngster, I could beat any thing in all
Virginny in the way o' leaping. I got my old woman
by beating the smartest man on the Eastern Shore, and
I have took the oath and sworn it, that no man shall
marry my daughter without jumping for it. You understand
me boys. There's the green, and here's
Annette," he added, taking his daughter, who stood
timidly behind him, by the hand, "Now the one that
jumps the furthest on a 'dead level,' shall marry Annette
this very night."</p>

<p>This unique address was received by the young men
with applause. And many a youth as he bounded
gaily forward to the arena of trial, cast a glance of
anticipated victory back upon the lovely object of village
chivalry. The maidens left their looms and
quilting frames, the children their noisy sports, the
slaves their labors, and the old men their arm-chairs
and long pipes, to witness and triumph in the success
of the victor. All prophesied and many wished that it
would be young Carroll. He was the handsomest and
best-humored youth in the county, and all knew that
a strong and mutual attachment existed between him
and the fair Annette. Carroll had won the reputation
of being the "best leaper," and in a country where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
such athletic achievements were the <i>sine qua non</i> of a
man's cleverness, this was no ordinary honor. In a
contest like the present, he had therefore every advantage
over his fellow <i>athletæ</i>.</p>

<p>The arena allotted for this hymeneal contest, was a
level space in front of the village-inn, and near the
centre of a grass-plat, reserved in the midst of the village
denominated "the green." The verdure was
quite worn off at this place by previous exercises of a
similar kind, and a hard surface of sand more befittingly
for the purpose to which it was to be used, supplied
its place.</p>

<p>The father of the lovely, blushing, and withal <i>happy</i>
prize, (for she well knew who would win,) with three
other patriarchal villagers were the judges appointed
to decide upon the claims of the several competitors.
The last time Carroll tried his skill in this exercise, he
"cleared"&mdash;to use the leaper's phraseology&mdash;twenty-one
feet and one inch.</p>

<p>The signal was given, and by lot the young men
stepped into the arena.</p>

<p>"Edward Grayson, seventeen feet," cried one of
the judges. The youth had done his utmost. He
was a pale, intellectual student. But what had intellect
to do in such an arena? Without looking at the
maiden he slowly left the ground.</p>

<p>"Dick Boulden, nineteen feet." Dick with a laugh
turned away, and replaced his coat.</p>

<p>"Harry Preston, nineteen feet and three inches."
"Well done Harry Preston," shouted the spectators,
"you have tried hard for the acres and homestead."</p>

<p>Harry also laughed and swore he only "jumped for
the fun of the thing." Harry was a rattle-brained fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
but never thought of matrimony. He loved to
walk and talk, and laugh and romp with Annette, but
sober marriage never came into his head. He only
jumped "for the fun of the thing." He would not
have said so, if sure of winning.</p>

<p>"Charley Simms, fifteen feet and a half." "Hurrah
for Charley! Charley'll win!" cried the crowd
good-humoredly. Charley Simms was the cleverest
fellow in the world. His mother had advised him to
stay at home, and told him if he ever won a wife, she
would fall in love with his good temper, rather than
his legs. Charley however made the trial of the latter's
capabilities and lost. Many refused to enter the
lists altogether. Others made the trial, and only one
of the leapers had yet cleared twenty feet.</p>

<p>"Now," cried the villagers, "let's see Henry Carroll.
He ought to beat this," and every one appeared,
as they called to mind the mutual love of the last competitor
and the sweet Annette, as if they heartily wished
his success.</p>

<p>Henry stepped to his post with a firm tread. His
eye glanced with confidence around upon the villagers
and rested, before he bounded forward, upon the
face of Annette, as if to catch therefrom that spirit and
assurance which the occasion called for. Returning
the encouraging glance with which she met his own,
with a proud smile upon his lip, he bounded forward.</p>

<p>"Twenty-one feet and a half!" shouted the multitude,
repeating the announcement of one of the judges,
"twenty-one feet and a half. Harry Carroll forever.
Annette and Harry." Hands, caps, and kerchiefs
waved over the heads of the spectators, and the eyes
of the delighted Annette sparkled with joy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>When Harry Carroll moved to his station to strive
for the prize, a tall, gentlemanly young man in a military
undress frock-coat, who had rode up to the inn,
dismounted and joined the spectators, unperceived,
while the contest was going on, stepped suddenly forward,
and with a "knowing eye," measured deliberately
the space accomplished by the last leaper. He
was a stranger in the village. His handsome face and
easy address attracted the eyes of the village maidens,
and his manly and sinewy frame, in which symmetry
and strength were happily united, called forth the admiration
of the young men.</p>

<p>"Mayhap, sir stranger, you think you can beat that,"
said one of the by-standers, remarking the manner in
which the eye of the stranger scanned the area. "If
you can leap beyond Harry Carroll, you'll beat the
best man in the colonies." The truth of this observation
was assented to by a general murmur.</p>

<p>"Is it for mere amusement you are pursuing this
pastime?" inquired the youthful stranger, "or is
there a prize for the winner?"</p>

<p>"Annette, the loveliest and wealthiest of our village-maidens,
is to be the reward of the victor," cried one
of the judges.</p>

<p>"Are the lists open to all?"</p>

<p>"All, young sir!" replied the father of Annette,
with interest,&mdash;his youthful ardour rising as he surveyed
the proportions of the straight-limbed young stranger.
"She is the bride of him who out-leaps Henry
Carroll. If you will try, you are free to do so. But
let me tell you, Harry Carroll has no rival in Virginny.
Here is my daughter, sir, look at her and make your
trial."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The young officer glanced upon the trembling maiden
about to be offered on the altar of her father's unconquerable
monomania, with an admiring eye. The
poor girl looked at Harry, who stood near with a troubled
brow and angry eye, and then cast upon the new
competitor an imploring glance.</p>

<p>Placing his coat in the hands of one of the judges, he
drew a sash he wore beneath it tighter around his waist,
and taking the appointed stand, made, apparently without
effort, the bound that was to decide the happiness
or misery of Henry and Annette.</p>

<p>"Twenty two feet one inch!" shouted the judge.
The announcement was repeated with surprise by the
spectators, who crowded around the victor, filling the
air with congratulations, not unmingled, however, with
loud murmurs from those who were more nearly interested
in the happiness of the lovers.</p>

<p>The old man approached, and grasping his hand exultingly,
called him his son, and said he felt prouder
of him than if he were a prince. Physical activity
and strength were the old leaper's true patents of nobility.</p>

<p>Resuming his coat, the victor sought with his eye
the fair prize he had, although nameless and unknown,
so fairly won. She leaned upon her father's arm, pale
and distressed.</p>

<p>Her lover stood aloof, gloomy and mortified, admiring
the superiority of the stranger in an exercise
in which he prided himself as unrivalled, while he hated
him for his success.</p>

<p>"Annette, my pretty prize," said the victor, taking
her passive hand&mdash;"I have won you fairly." Annette's
cheek became paler than marble; she trembled like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
an aspen-leaf, and clung closer to her father, while
her drooping eye sought the form of her lover. His
brow grew dark at the stranger's language.</p>

<p>"I have won you, my pretty flower, to make you a
bride!&mdash;tremble not so violently&mdash;I mean not for myself,
however proud I might be," he added with gallantry,
"to wear so fair a gem next my heart. Perhaps,"
and he cast his eyes around inquiringly, while the current
of life leaped joyfully to her brow, and a murmur
of surprise run through the crowd&mdash;"perhaps there is
some favored youth among the competitors, who has a
higher claim to this jewel. Young Sir," he continued,
turning to the surprised Henry, "methinks you
were victor in the lists before me,&mdash;I strove not for the
maiden, though one could not well strive for a fairer&mdash;but
from love for the manly sport in which I saw you
engaged. You are the victor, and as such, with the
permission of this worthy assembly, receive from my
hands the prize you have so well and honorably won."</p>

<p>The youth sprung forward and grasped his hand
with gratitude; and the next moment, Annette was
weeping from pure joy upon his shoulders. The welkin
rung with the acclamations of the delighted villagers,
and amid the temporary excitement produced by
this act, the stranger withdrew from the crowd, mounted
his horse, and spurred at a brisk trot through the
village.</p>

<p>That night, Henry and Annette were married, and
the health of the mysterious and noble-hearted stranger,
was drunk in over-flowing bumpers of rustic beverage.</p>

<p>In process of time, there were born unto the married
pair, sons and daughters, and Harry Carroll had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
become Colonel Henry Carroll, of the Revolutionary
army.</p>

<p>One evening, having just returned home after a hard
campaign, he was sitting with his family on the gallery
of his handsome country-house, when an advance
courier rode up and announced the approach of General
Washington and suite, informing him that he should
crave his hospitality for the night. The necessary directions
were given in reference to the household preparations,
and Col. Carroll, ordering his horse, rode forward
to meet and escort to his house the distinguished
guest, whom he had never yet seen, although serving
in the same widely-extended army.</p>

<p>That evening at the table, Annette, now become
the dignified, matronly and still handsome Mrs. Carroll,
could not keep her eyes from the face of her illustrious
visitor. Every moment or two she would steal a
glance at his commanding features, and half-doubtingly,
half-assumedly, shake her head and look again and
again, to be still more puzzled. Her absence of mind
and embarrassment at length became evident to her
husband who, inquired affectionately if she were ill?</p>

<p>"I suspect, Colonel," said the General, who had
been some time, with a quiet, meaning smile, observing
the lady's curious and puzzled survey of his features&mdash;"that
Mrs. Carroll thinks she recognizes in me an old
acquaintance." And he smiled with a mysterious air,
as he gazed upon both alternately.</p>

<p>The Colonel stared, and a faint memory of the past
seemed to be revived, as he gazed, while the lady rose
impulsively from her chair, and bending eagerly forward
over the tea-urn, with clasped hands and an eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of intense, eager inquiry, fixed full upon him, stood for
a moment with her lips parted as if she would speak.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my dear madam&mdash;pardon me, Colonel,
I must put an end to this scene. I have become, by
dint of camp-fare and hard usage, too unwieldy to leap
again twenty-two feet one inch, even for so fair a bride
as one I wot of."</p>

<p>The recognition, with the surprise, delight and happiness
that followed, are left to the imagination of the
reader.</p>

<p>General Washington was indeed the handsome young
"leaper," whose mysterious appearance and disappearance
in the native village of the lovers, is still traditionary,
and whose claim to a substantial body of <i>bona fide</i>
flesh and blood, was stoutly contested by the village
story-tellers, until the happy <i>denouement</i> which took
place at the hospitable mansion of Col. Carroll.</p>

<h2><a name="INDIFFERENCE_TO_STUDY" id="INDIFFERENCE_TO_STUDY"></a>INDIFFERENCE TO STUDY.</h2>

<h3>By George W. Light.</h3>

<blockquote><p>We only find out what we have a sincere desire to know. All men have in themselves
nearly the same fund of primitive ideas; they have especially the same moral fund; the difference
which there is in men, comes from the fact, that some improve this fund, while others
neglect it.</p>

<div class="author">
<i>Degerando.</i><br />
</div></blockquote>


<p>No argument ought to be required at the present day,
to prove that all men, however their capacities may
differ in kind or degree, possess the natural ability to
make considerable progress in some useful study. The
principles of our government proceed upon this ground,
and place every man under strong moral obligation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
make the most of himself, that he may be able to bear
the responsibility that rests upon him. The protestant
principle, that all men have the right to judge for themselves
in matters relating to religion, is founded on the
same basis. Even the principles of trade&mdash;which every
body is supposed to be able to know&mdash;call for the
exercise of no small amount of intellect, to understand
and apply them to their full extent. The intimate connection
between the arts and sciences proves conclusively,
that those who are engaged in the one, ought to
be acquainted with the other. We are aware of the
common belief, that the study of the sciences is not
necessary with the mass of the community who are
engaged in the various active pursuits. But this narrow
view is fast going out of date. The progress of
<i>steam</i>, if nothing else, will ere long convince the most
incredulous, by its abridgment of human labor, that
the great body of mankind were intended for something
besides mere machines. The sciences of law and
medicine are no more closely connected with the practice
of the lawyer and physician, than mechanical and
agricultural science with the business of the mechanic
and farmer. The same may be said of other sciences,
as, for instance, of Political Economy, in its application
to mercantile affairs. In accordance with the spirit of
these views, opportunities for instruction are provided,
and means of self-education are multiplied, to an unparalleled
degree.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, however, the general admission of
the truth under consideration, not a few persons who
think the improvement of their minds a matter of little
importance, undertake to excuse themselves, by modestly
confessing that they have no natural taste for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
study&mdash;that they cannot study. But it is difficult to
understand how they can be so blinded to the resources
they have within them, under the light which this day
of civilization is pouring upon them. Where do they
suppose themselves to be? Are they in some dark
domain, shut out from all the soul-stirring influences of
a boundless universe, dragging out an existence as
hopeless as it is degraded?&mdash;or do they dwell in the
midst of a glorious creation, with no understanding to
unravel its divine mysteries, and no heart to be moved
by the eloquence of its inspiration? One of these
things must be true, if we may reason from their own
language. If they do possess the high faculties of the
soul, and can do nothing for their cultivation, it cannot
be that they have their dwelling-place upon a world
belonging to the magnificent empire of God. There
can be no sun blazing down upon them, flooding the
earth with his glory, and giving fresh life and beauty
to every living thing. The evening can reveal to them
no myriads of stars, burning with holy lustre beyond
the clouds of heaven. They can see no mountains
towering to the skies; no green valleys, spangled with
the flowers of the earth, smiling around them. They
can hear no anthem sounding from the depths of the
ocean. They can see no lightnings flashing in the
broad expanse,&mdash;nor hear the artillery of heaven thundering
over the firmament, as if it would shake the
very pillars of the universe. If they could see and
hear this, with minds awake to the most noble objects
of contemplation, and hearts susceptible of the loftiest
impulses, they would inquire about the earth they tread
upon, the beautiful things scattered in such profusion
around them, and the sun and the ever-burning stars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
above them. And they would not stop here. They
would search into the mysteries of their own nature.
They would look into the wonders of that upper life,
where the sun of an eternal kingdom burns in its lofty
arches, where the rivers of life flow from the everlasting
mountains, and where the pure spirits of the earth
shall shine like the stars forever.</p>

<p>But, however paradoxical it may seem, these men do
dwell in the grand universe of God&mdash;and they do possess
inexhaustible minds: and they have been compelled
to quench the brightest flames and to prevent the
swelling of the purest fountains of their existence, in
order to descend to the condition of which they complain.
The Creator doomed them to no such degradation.
The truth is, they know nothing of themselves.
They do not understand their relations to the creation
that surrounds them. They do not comprehend the
great purpose to which all their labors should tend.
They waste those hours which might be devoted to the
elevation of their being, in practices that render them
insensible to the glories of the universe in which they
dwell, and to the sublime destiny for which they were
created. They deny themselves to be the workmanship
of God.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_VILLAGE_OF_AUTEUIL" id="THE_VILLAGE_OF_AUTEUIL"></a>THE VILLAGE OF AUTEUIL.</h2>

<h3>By Henry W. Longfellow.</h3>


<p>The sultry heat of summer always brings with it, to
the idler and the man of leisure, a longing for the leafy
shade and the green luxuriance of the country. It is
pleasant to interchange the din of the city, the movement
of the crowd, and the gossip of society, with the
silence of the hamlet, the quiet seclusion of the grove,
and the gossip of a woodland brook.</p>

<p>It was a feeling of this kind that prompted me, during
my residence in the north of France, to pass one
of the summer months at Auteuil&mdash;the pleasantest of
the many little villages that lie in the immediate vicinity
of the metropolis. It is situated on the outskirts of
the <i>Bois de Boulogne</i>&mdash;a wood of some extent, in
whose green alleys the dusty cit enjoys the luxury of
an evening drive, and gentlemen meet in the morning
to give each other satisfaction in the usual way. A
cross-road, skirted with green hedge-rows, and over-shadowed
by tall poplars, leads you from the noisy
highway of St. Cloud and Versailles to the still retirement
of this suburban hamlet. On either side the eye
discovers old chateaux amid the trees, and green parks,
whose pleasant shades recall a thousand images of La
Fontaine, Racine, and Moliere; and on an eminence,
overlooking the windings of the Seine, and giving a
beautiful though distant view of the domes and gardens
of Paris, rises the village of Passy, long the residence
of our countrymen Franklin and Count Rumford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>I took up my abode at a <i>Maison de Sante</i>; not that
I was a valetudinarian,&mdash;but because I there found
some one to whom I could whisper, "How sweet is
solitude!" Behind the house was a garden filled with
fruit-trees of various kinds, and adorned with gravel-walks
and green arbours, furnished with tables and
rustic seats, for the repose of the invalid and the sleep
of the indolent. Here the inmates of the rural hospital
met on common ground, to breathe the invigorating
air of morning, and while away the lazy noon or vacant
evening with tales of the sick chamber.</p>

<p>The establishment was kept by Dr. Dent-de-lion, a
dried up little fellow, with red hair, a sandy complexion,
and the physiognomy and gestures of a monkey.
His character corresponded to his outward lineaments;
for he had all a monkey's busy and curious impertinence.
Nevertheless, such as he was, the village Æsculapius
strutted forth the little great man of Auteuil.
The peasants looked up to him as to an oracle,&mdash;he
contrived to be at the head of every thing, and laid
claim to the credit of all public improvements in the
village: in fine, he was a great man on a small scale.</p>

<p>It was within the dingy walls of this little potentate's
imperial palace that I chose my country residence. I
had a chamber in the second story, with a solitary
window, which looked upon the street, and gave me a
peep into a neighbor's garden. This I esteemed a great
privilege; for, as a stranger, I desired to see all that
was passing out of doors; and the sight of green trees,
though growing on another man's ground, is always a
blessing. Within doors&mdash;had I been disposed to quarrel
with my household gods&mdash;I might have taken some
objection to my neighborhood; for, on one side of me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
was a consumptive patient, whose graveyard cough
drove me from my chamber by day; and on the other,
an English colonel, whose incoherent ravings, in the
delirium of a high and obstinate fever, often broke my
slumbers by night: but I found ample amends for these
inconveniences in the society of those who were so
little indisposed as hardly to know what ailed them,
and those who, in health themselves, had accompanied
a friend or relative to the shades of the country in pursuit
of it. To these I am indebted for much courtesy;
and particularly to one who, if these pages should ever
meet her eye, will not, I hope, be unwilling to accept
this slight memorial of a former friendship.</p>

<p>It was, however, to the <i>Bois de Boulogne</i> that I
looked for my principal recreation. There I took my
solitary walk, morning and evening; or, mounted on a
little mouse-colored donkey, paced demurely along the
woodland pathway. I had a favorite seat beneath the
shadow of a venerable oak, one of the few hoary patriarchs
of the wood which had survived the bivouacs of
the allied armies. It stood upon the brink of a little
glassy pool, whose tranquil bosom was the image of a
quiet and secluded life, and stretched its parental arms
over a rustic bench, that had been constructed beneath
it for the accommodation of the foot-traveller, or, perchance,
some idle dreamer like myself. It seemed to
look round with a lordly air upon its old hereditary
domain, whose stillness was no longer broken by the
tap of the martial drum, nor the discordant clang of
arms; and, as the breeze whispered among its branches,
it seemed to be holding friendly colloquies with a
few of its venerable contemporaries, who stooped from
the opposite bank of the pool, nodding gravely now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
then, and ogling themselves with a sigh in the mirror
below.</p>

<p>In this quiet haunt of rural repose I used to sit at
noon, hear the birds sing, and "possess myself in much
quietness." Just at my feet lay the little silver pool,
with the sky and the woods painted in its mimic vault,
and occasionally the image of a bird, or the soft watery
outline of a cloud, floating silently through its sunny
hollows. The water-lily spread its broad green leaves
on the surface, and rocked to sleep a little world of
insect life in its golden cradle. Sometimes a wandering
leaf came floating and wavering downward, and
settled on the water; then a vagabond insect would
break the smooth surface into a thousand ripples, or a
green-coated frog slide from the bank, and plump!
dive headlong to the bottom.</p>

<p>I entered, too, with some enthusiasm, into all the
rural sports and merrimakes of the village. The holy-days
were so many little eras of mirth and good feeling;
for the French have that happy and sunshine temperament&mdash;that
merry-go-mad character&mdash;which makes
all their social meetings scenes of enjoyment and hilarity.
I made it a point never to miss any of the <i>Fetes
Champetres</i>, or rural dances, at the wood of Boulogne;
though I confess it sometimes gave me a momentary
uneasiness to see my rustic throne beneath the oak
usurped by a noisy group of girls, the silence and decorum
of my imaginary realm broken by music and
laughter, and, in a word, my whole kingdom turned
topsyturvy, with romping, fiddling, and dancing. But
I am naturally, and from principle, too, a lover of all
those innocent amusements which cheer the laborers'
toil, and, as it were, put their shoulders to the wheel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
life, and help the poor man along with his load of cares.
Hence I saw with no small delight the rustic swain
astride the wooden horse of the <i>carrousal</i>, and the village
maiden whirling round and round in its dizzy car;
or took my stand on a rising ground that overlooked
the dance, an idle spectator in a busy throng. It was
just where the village touched the outward border of
the wood. There a little area had been levelled beneath
the trees, surrounded by a painted rail, with a
row of benches inside. The music was placed in a
slight balcony, built around the trunk of a large tree in
the centre, and the lamps, hanging from the branches
above, gave a gay, fantastic, and fairy look to the
scene. How often in such moments did I recall the
lines of Goldsmith, describing those "kinder skies,"
beneath which "France displays her bright domain,"
and feel how true and masterly the sketch,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alike all ages; dames of ancient days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have led their children through the mirthful maze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gay grandsire, skilled in gestic lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has frisked beneath the burden of threescore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I was one morning called to my window by the
sound of rustic music. I looked out, and beheld a procession
of villagers advancing along the road, attired in
gay dresses, and marching merrily on in the direction
of the church. I soon perceived that it was a marriage
festival. The procession was led by a long orangoutang
of a man, in a straw hat and white dimity bob-coat,
playing on an asthmatic clarionet, from which he
contrived to blow unearthly sounds, ever and anon
squeaking off at right angles from his tune, and winding
up with a grand flourish on the guttural notes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Behind him, led by his little boy, came the blind fiddler,
his honest features glowing with all the hilarity of
a rustic bridal, and, as he stumbled along, sawing away
upon his fiddle till he made all crack again. Then
came the happy bridegroom, dressed in his Sunday
suit of blue, with a large nosegay in his button-hole,
and close beside him his blushing bride, with downcast
eyes, clad in a white robe and slippers, and wearing a
wreath of white roses in her hair. The friends and
relatives brought up the procession; and a troop of village
urchins came shouting along in the rear, scrambling
among themselves for the largess of sous and
sugar-plums that now and then issued in large handfuls
from the pockets of a lean man in black, who seemed
to officiate as master of ceremonies on the occasion.
I gazed on the procession till it was out of sight; and
when the last wheeze of the clarionet died upon my
ear, I could not help thinking how happy were they
who were thus to dwell together in the peaceful bosom
of their native village, far from the gilded misery and
the pestilential vices of the town.</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day, I was sitting by the
window, enjoying the freshness of the air and the beauty
and stillness of the hour, when I heard the distant
and solemn hymn of the Catholic burial-service, at first
so faint and indistinct that it seemed an illusion. It
rose mournfully on the hush of evening&mdash;died gradually
away&mdash;then ceased. Then it rose again, nearer
and more distinct, and soon after a funeral procession
appeared, and passed directly beneath my window. It
was led by a priest, bearing the banner of the church,
and followed by two boys, holding long flambeaux in
their hands. Next came a double file of priests in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
white surplices, with a missal in one hand and a lighted
wax taper in the other, chanting the funeral dirge
at intervals,&mdash;now pausing, and then again taking up
the mournful burden of their lamentation, accompanied
by others, who played upon a rude kind of horn, with
a dismal and wailing sound. Then followed various
symbols of the church, and the bier borne on the
shoulders of four men. The coffin was covered with a
black velvet pall, and a chaplet of white flowers lay
upon it, indicating that the deceased was unmarried.
A few of the villagers came behind, clad in mourning
robes, and bearing lighted tapers. The procession
passed slowly along the same street that in the morning
had been thronged by the gay bridal company. A
melancholy train of thought forced itself home upon
my mind. The joys and sorrows of this world are so
strikingly mingled! Our mirth and grief are brought so
mournfully in contact! We laugh while others weep,
and others rejoice when we are sad! The light heart
and the heavy walk side by side, and go about together!
Beneath the same roof are spread the wedding
feast and the funeral pall! The bridal song mingles
with the burial hymn! One goes to the marriage bed,
another to the grave; and all is mutable, uncertain,
and transitory.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PAST_AND_THE_NEW_YEAR" id="THE_PAST_AND_THE_NEW_YEAR"></a>THE PAST AND THE NEW YEAR.</h2>

<h3>By Prentiss Mellen.</h3>


<p>The close of the year, whose last knell has just been
heard, amid the chills and gloom of winter, when all
around reminds us of our departed friends and the loss
we have sustained, is peculiarly adapted to arouse us
from our inattention to the lapse of time, and impress
on our hearts the solemn truth that life itself is but a
vapor. Many, it is true, when they look into the grave
of the year, may experience a rush of bitter feeling,
as they fondly recollect how many cherished hopes
they have been called upon to bury in the tomb, during
the lapse of the year: how many friends have proved
false or ungrateful&mdash;how many of their suns have gone
down in the gloom of solitude, or amidst scenes of
sickness and poverty, or of sighing and sorrow. All
this is true, and such ever has been and ever will be
the complexion of human life. But though thousands
are thus educated in a school where such is the salutary
discipline, yet millions have been spending the year in
peace and joy&mdash;in health and abundance. Their journey
has been gladdened with sunshine, and their course
has been through fields of beauty and beside "the still
waters of comfort." It is useful&mdash;it is a species of
<i>gratitude</i> thus to look back and trace the course we
have been pursuing. If it has been delightful or smooth
and peaceful, our hearts should melt in tenderness
while we look to the <i>fountain</i> of all our blessings. If
our course has been wearisome through fields of sterili<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>ty,
or melancholy and companionless, we should remember
that Wisdom and Goodness preside over our destinies,
whether we are breasting the storm, or calmly
beholding the rainbow of promise. The year that has
bidden us adieu, was pleasant in its course, and its decline
gradual and beautiful. An unusual degree of
softness distinguished its autumn, resembling the last
years of the life of man, when the agitation of the passions
has in a great measure subsided; when his feelings
have become tranquilized, and all around him
peaceful and serene, if he has been careful to regulate
his conduct, on life's journey, by the principles of justice
and the commands of duty&mdash;if in his social intercourse
his passions have been preserved in due subjection
to the gentle influences of a benevolent heart,
displaying itself in acts of mercy like the good Samaritan.</p>

<div class="cpoem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">"Sure the last end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the good man is peace. How calm his exit!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night dews fall not more gently on the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor weary, worn-out winds expire so soft."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The new year to which we have just been introduced
is, in one sense, a perfect stranger, though we have
long been intimate with the <i>family</i> to which it belongs,
and of course have some general acquaintance with
certain features of its character, leading us to anticipate
its promises and its failure to perform them in
many instances,&mdash;its smiles and its tears&mdash;its flatteries
and its frowns&mdash;its gaieties and hopes&mdash;its gradual decline&mdash;decay
and dissolution:&mdash;but we have abundant
reason too for indulging the belief that we may enjoy
thousands of blessings, if we are disposed to cherish
proper feelings&mdash;to be kind and courteous and obliging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and ever on our guard to avoid unnecessarily wounding
the feelings of others; ever ready to acknowledge the
favors we receive, and render a suitable return. How
easily all this may be done! How often is it grossly
neglected! He who consults <i>his own</i> ease and comfort
cannot in any manner attain the desired result so
readily and certainly, as by habitually consulting the
ease and comfort of others, with whom he is in the
habit of associating: and this is true politeness also.
A man who is dissatisfied with himself and those around
him, and laboring under the darkening influence of disturbed
or morose feelings "may travel from Dan to
Beersheba and say it is all barren;"&mdash;to him it will
appear so; and the effect would be the same if his
journey lay amidst the most delightful scenes of rural
beauty. The seasons of the year all give their annual
<i>lessons</i> for instruction: It is our wisdom to regard them
carefully. <i>Spring</i> summons us all to cheerful activity,
with assurances that our labor will not be in vain.
<i>Summer</i> performs what <i>Spring</i> had promised, and
shews us the advantage of listening to early instruction
and wisely improving it. Ten thousand songsters are
filling the branches with their animating strains of music
and gratitude, and teaching us to enjoy, as they do,
the countless blessings and bounties of nature; <i>their</i>
music is never failing&mdash;nor do we see it ending in <i>discords</i>.
Let us all, as we journey onward together
through the year, learn to tune our <i>hearts</i> as they do
their <i>voices</i>, and pass the fleeting period in harmony,
and in that <i>cheerfulness</i> which the excellent Addison
has honored with the name of a <i>continual expression of
gratitude to Heaven</i>. In Germany the <i>study</i> and <i>practice</i>
of music are general among the people. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
other advantages resulting from making music a part
of common education, it is not romantic or utopian to
observe that it teaches how easily music&mdash;pure and
surpassing music&mdash;may be made on the <i>same</i> instrument,
which under an ignorant or purposed touch will
send forth discords in prodigious varieties. He who
has become <i>acquainted</i> with the instrument, though
not a <i>master</i> of it, well knows how to <i>avoid</i> those combinations
of sound which are painful to the ear, and
often tend to disturb feelings and passions. What
tones are sweeter than those produced by the gentle
breeze of heaven in passing over the strings of the
Æolian Harp? The reason is, those strings are so
attuned as that their vibrations will not respond except
in notes of harmony: but only disorder the strings, by
increasing the tension of some and decreasing that of
others, and the sweetest zephyr will produce nothing
but the vilest discords, resembling angry passions. Let
us then, in our journey through the year on which we
have entered, acquire as much as possible a knowledge
of the <i>science</i> and the <i>art</i> of social and domestic <i>moral
music</i>. Let us learn to measure our <i>time</i> with care, to
cultivate our <i>voices</i>, that they may lose all harshness:
let each attend to <i>his own part</i>, and strive to excel in
that. Let us consider our <i>feelings</i>, <i>passions</i> and <i>dispositions</i>,
as the <i>strings of the Harp</i>; and the <i>ordinary
events of life</i> as the <i>breezes</i> which give vibration
to the strings: if these strings&mdash;our feelings, passions
and dispositions&mdash;are in proper tune&mdash;under due regulation,
and preserving a just relation, each to all the
others, we have then all the elements of moral music,
domestic and social, and in a few weeks, by due regard
to all the principles and arrangement above mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
we shall soon be good scholars, <i>giving</i> and <i>receiving</i>
all that pleasure which harmony can afford; and as
the sober <i>autumn</i> advances, our <i>tastes</i> for this kind of
music will be more and more ripened towards perfection;
and when the cold <i>decemberly</i> evenings shall arrive,
we can listen to the <i>angry music</i> of the elements
abroad, full of discordant strains, sweeping by our peaceful
homes, while <i>within</i> them all may be the music
of the heart, in its gentlest movements.</p>

<p>It is a melancholy truth that we ourselves manufacture
seven eighths of what we are disposed to term our
<i>misfortunes</i> in this world. Want of precaution mars
our arrangements: want of prudence exposes us to
dangers which we might easily have avoided&mdash;want of
patience often hurries us into difficulties, and disqualifies
us to bear them with calmness or decency. Indulgence
in follies and fashions often plants the seeds
of wasting disease. Intemperance in our passions always
is followed by unwelcome sensations, and sometimes
with a sense of shame. Stimulants are succeeded
by debility, and when they are used to excess, we
know and daily witness the dreadful results&mdash;if death
is not one of them&mdash;either the death of the offender, or
of some other destroyed by his hand in the tempest of
infuriated passions&mdash;we are too often compelled to
mourn over the desolation they occasion&mdash;presenting
in one view,</p>

<span class="i2">It was still noon&mdash;and Sabbath. The pale air<br /></span>

<span class="i2">I heard the rude laugh break from ruder hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Those ruffian exclamations of lost souls,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At which a better spirit wakes and starts&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The revelry of demons o'er their bowls&mdash;<br /></span>

<h2><a name="COURTSHIP" id="COURTSHIP"></a>COURTSHIP.</h2>

<h3>By Wm. L. McClintock.</h3>


<p>After my sleighride, last winter, and the slippery
trick I was served by Patty Bean, nobody would suspect
me of hankering after the women again in a hurry.
To hear me curse and swear and rail out against the
whole feminine gender, you would have taken it for
granted that I should never so much as look at one
again, to all eternity&mdash;O, but I was wicked. "Darn
and blast their eyes"&mdash;says I.&mdash;"Blame their skins&mdash;torment
their hearts and darn them to darnation." Finally
I took an oath and swore that if I ever meddled
or had any dealings with them again (in the sparking
line I mean) I wish I might be hung and choked.</p>

<p>But swearing off from women, and then going into a
meeting house chock full of gals, all shining and glistening
in their Sunday clothes and clean faces, is like
swearing off from liquor and going into a grog shop.
It's all smoke.</p>

<p>I held out and kept firm to my oath for three whole
Sundays. Forenoons, a'ternoons and intermissions complete.
On the fourth, there were strong symptoms of
a change of weather. A chap, about my size was
seen on the way to the meeting house, with a new patent
hat on; his head hung by the ears upon a shirt
collar; his cravat had a pudding in it and branched
out in front, into a double bow knot. He carried a
straight back and a stiff neck, as a man ought to, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
he has his best clothes on; and every time he spit, he
sprung his body forward, like a jack-knife, in order to
shoot clear of the ruffles.</p>

<p>Squire Jones' pew is next but two to mine; and
when I stand up to prayers and take my coat tail under
my arm, and turn my back to the minister, I naturally
look right straight at Sally Jones. Now Sally has got
a face not to be grinned at, in a fog. Indeed, as regards
beauty, some folks think she can pull an even
yoke with Patty Bean. For my part, I think there is
not much boot between them. Any how, they are so
nigh matched that they have hated and despised each
other, like rank poison, ever since they were school-girls.</p>

<p>Squire Jones had got his evening fire on, and set
himself down to reading the great bible, when he heard
a rap at his door. "Walk in.&mdash;Well, John, how der
do? Git out, Pompey."&mdash;"Pretty well, I thank ye, Squire,
and how do <i>you</i> do?"&mdash;"Why, so as to be crawling&mdash;ye
ugly beast, will ye hold yer yop&mdash;haul up a chair and
set down, John."</p>

<p>"How do <i>you</i> do, Mrs. Jones?" "O, middlin', how's
yer marm? Don't forget the mat, there, Mr. Beedle."
This put me in mind that I had been off soundings
several times, in the long muddy lane; and my boots
were in a sweet pickle.</p>

<p>It was now old Captain Jones' turn, the grandfather.
Being roused from a doze, by the bustle and racket, he
opened both his eyes, at first with wonder and astonishment.
At last he began to halloo so loud that you
might hear him a mile; for he takes it for granted
that every body is just exactly as deaf as he is.</p>

<p>"Who is it? I say, who in the world is it?" Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Jones going close to his ear, screamed out, "it's Johnny
Beedle."&mdash;"Ho&mdash;Johnny Beedle. I remember, he
was one summer at the siege of Boston."&mdash;"No, no,
father, bless your heart, that was his grandfather, that's
been dead and gone this twenty year."&mdash;"Ho,&mdash;But
where does he come from?"&mdash;"Daown taown."&mdash;"Ho.&mdash;And
what does he follow for a livin'?"&mdash;And he did
not stop asking questions, after this sort, till all the
particulars of the Beedle family were published and
proclaimed in Mrs. Jones' last screech. He then sunk
back into his doze again.</p>

<p>The dog stretched himself before one andiron; the
cat squat down before the other. Silence came on by
degrees, like a calm snow storm, till nothing was heard
but a cricket under the hearth, keeping tune with a
sappy yellow birch forestick. Sally sat up prim, as if
she were pinned to the chair-back; her hands crossed
genteelly upon her lap, and her eyes looking straight
into the fire. Mammy Jones tried to straighten herself
too, and laid her hands across in her lap. But they
would not lay still. It was full twenty-four hours since
they had done any work, and they were out of all
patience with keeping Sunday.&mdash;Do what she would to
keep them quiet, they would bounce up, now and then,
and go through the motions, in spite of the fourth commandment.
For my part <i>I</i> sat looking very much
like a fool. The more I tried to say something the
more my tongue stuck fast. I put my right leg over
the left and said "hem." Then I changed, and put
the left leg over the right. It was no use; the silence
kept coming on thicker and thicker. The drops of
sweat began to crawl all over me. I got my eye upon
my hat, hanging on a peg, on the road to the door;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and then I eyed the door. At this moment, the old
Captain, all at once sung out "Johnny Beedle!" It
sounded like a clap of thunder, and I started right up
an eend.</p>

<p>"Johnny Beedle, you'll never handle sich a drumstick
as your father did, if yer live to the age of Methusaler.
He would toss up his drumstick, and while
it was whirlin' in the air, take off a gill er rum, and
then ketch it as it come down, without losin' a stroke
in the tune. What d'ye think of that, ha? But scull
your chair round, close along side er me, so yer can
hear.&mdash;Now, what have you come a'ter?"&mdash;"I&mdash;a'ter?
O, jest takin' a walk. Pleasant walkin' I guess. I
mean jest to see how ye all do." "Ho.&mdash;That's another
lie. You've come a courtin', Johnny Beedle; you're
a'ter our Sal. Say now, d'ye want to marry, or only
to court?"</p>

<p>This is what I call a choker. Poor Sally made but
one jump and landed in the middle of the kitchen; and
then she skulked in the dark corner, till the old man,
after laughing himself into a whooping cough, was put
to bed.</p>

<p>Then came apples and cider; and, the ice being
broke, plenty chat with mammy Jones about the minister
and the 'sarmon.' I agreed with her to a nicety,
upon all the points of doctrine; but I had forgot the
text and all the heads of the discourse, but six. Then
she teazed and tormented me to tell who I accounted
the best singer in the gallery, that day. But, mum&mdash;there
was no getting that out of me. "Praise to the
face is often disgrace" says I, throwing a sly squint
at Sally.</p>

<p>At last, Mrs. Jones lighted t'other candle; and after
charging Sally to look well to the fire, she led the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to bed, and the Squire gathered up his shoes and stockings
and followed.</p>

<p>Sally and I were left sitting a good yard apart, honest
measure. For fear of getting tongue-tied again, I
set right in, with a steady stream of talk. I told her
all the particulars about the weather that was past,
and also made some pretty cute guesses at what it was
like to be in future. At first, I gave a hitch up with
my chair at every full stop. Then growing saucy, I
repeated it at every comma, and semicolon; and at
last, it was hitch, hitch, hitch, and I planted myself fast
by the side of her.</p>

<p>"I swow, Sally, you looked so plaguy handsome to
day, that I wanted to eat you up."&mdash;"Pshaw, get along
you," says she. My hand had crept along, somehow,
upon its fingers, and begun to scrape acquaintance with
hers. She sent it home again, with a desperate jerk.
"Try it agin"&mdash;no better luck. "Why, Miss Jones
you're gettin' upstropulous, a little old madish, I guess."
"Hands off is fair play, Mr. Beedle."</p>

<p>It is a good sign to find a girl sulkey. I knew
where the shoe pinched. It was that are Patty Bean
business. So I went to work to persuade her that I
had never had any notion after Patty, and to prove it I
fell to running her down at a great rate. Sally could
not help chiming in with me, and I rather guess Miss
Patty suffered a few. I, now, not only got hold of her
hand without opposition, but managed to slip an arm
round her waist. But there was no satisfying me; so
I must go to poking out my lips after a buss. I guess
I rued it. She fetched me a slap in the face that made
me see stars, and my ears rung like a brass kettle for
a quarter of an hour. I was forced to laugh at the
joke, tho' out of the wrong side of my mouth, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
gave my face something the look of a gridiron. The
battle now began in the regular way. "Ah, Sally,
give me a kiss, and ha' done with it, now."&mdash;"I won't, so
there, nor tech to."&mdash;"I'll take it, whether or no."&mdash;"Do it,
if you dare."&mdash;And at it we went, rough and tumble.
An odd destruction of starch now commenced. The
bow of my cravat was squat up in half a shake. At
the next bout, smash went shirt collar, and, at the same
time, some of the head fastenings gave way, and down
came Sally's hair in a flood, like a mill dam broke
loose,&mdash;carrying away half a dozen combs. One dig
of Sally's elbow, and my blooming ruffles wilted down
to a dish-cloth. But she had no time to boast. Soon
her neck tackling began to shiver. It parted at the
throat, and, whorah, came a whole school of blue and
white beads, scampering and running races every which
way, about the floor.</p>

<p>By the Hokey; if Sally Jones is'nt real grit, there's
no snakes. She fought fair, however, I must own, and
neither tried to bite nor scratch; and when she could
fight no longer, for want of breath, she yielded handsomely.
Her arms fell down by her sides, her head
back over her chair, her eyes closed and there lay her
little plump mouth, all in the air. Lord! did ye ever
see a hawk pounce upon a young robin? Or a bumblebee
upon a clover-top?&mdash;I say nothing.</p>

<p>Consarn it, how a buss will crack, of a still frosty
night. Mrs. Jones was about half way between asleep
and awake. "There goes my yeast bottle," says she to
herself&mdash;"burst into twenty hundred pieces, and my
bread is all dough agin."</p>

<p>The upshot of the matter is, I fell in love with Sally
Jones, head over ears. Every Sunday night, rain or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
shine, finds me rapping at 'Squire Jones' door, and
twenty times have I been within a hair's breadth of
popping the question. But now I have made a final resolve;
and if I live till next Sunday night, and I don't
get choked in the trial, Sally Jones will hear thunder.</p>

<h2><a name="BALLOONING" id="BALLOONING"></a>BALLOONING.</h2>

<h3>By I. McLellan, Jr.</h3>


<p>The clear sun of a fine September day, was glittering
on roof and steeple, and the cheerful breeze of early
autumn breathing its harp-like melody over woods and
waters. A vast multitude stood around me, attentively
watching the expanding folds of my balloon, as it
swayed to and fro in the unsteady air. As I prepared
to take my place in its car, I noticed an involuntary
shudder run through the assemblage, and anxious glances
pass from face to face. At length, the process of
inflation was completed, the music sounded, the gun
was discharged, the ropes were loosened, and the beautiful
machine arose in the air, amid the resounding
cheers of thousands. As it ascended, I cast a hasty
look on the sea of upturned heads, and thought I read
one general expression of anxiety, in the faces of the
multitudinous throng, and my heart warmed with the
consciousness, that many kind wishes and secret hopes
were wafted with me on my heavenward flight. But
very soon, mine eye ceased to distinguish features and
forms, and the collected throng became blended in one
confused mass, and the green common itself had dwindled
into a mere garden-plat, and the magnificent old
Elm in its centre to a stunted bush, waving on the
hill-side.</p>

<p>Upward, upward! my flying car mounted and mounted,
into the yet untraversed highways of the air, swifter
than pinion-borne bird, or canvas-borne vessel, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
all without sound of revolving wheel, or clatter of thundering
hoof or straining of bellying sail, or rustle of
flapping wing. I felt that I was indeed alone, in the
upper wastes of the liquid element, a solitary voyager
of the sky, careering onward like the spectral "Ship
of the Sea," with no murmur of bubbling billow under
the prow, and no gush of whirling ripple beneath the
keel. But how can my pen describe the sublimity of
the scene above, below and around! At one moment,
my car would plunge into silvery seas of vapor and
rolling billows of mist, through which the dim-seen sun
did but feebly glimmer, like the struggling flame of the
torch cast in the dungeon's gloom. But soon that
shadowy veil dissolved away, and again I would emerge
into the blaze of the golden sun, and the effulgence of
the blue heavens. How then did I covet the painter's
art, to be able to imprint on the eternal canvas, those
gorgeous clouds piled up around me, like hills and
mountains, from whose sides hoary cataracts seemed
to be falling, and foamy streams leaping into the vallies,
that rested in lovely repose at their base. Never
did the dull world below present on its diversified
bosom, such grand or such enchanting objects, as those
beautiful and evanescent creatures of the air, shining
and shifting in the levelled sunbeams around. At
times, my whole horizon would be bounded by those
mountainous regions of cloud-land, cliff lifting over
cliff, pinnacle above pinnacle, Alps above Alps. On
their sides and tops, the reflected light painted all the
hues of the rainbow, in commingled azure and crimson,
purple and gold. In those stupendous masses of
vapor, mine eye, with little aid of fancy, could trace
out resemblances of wild and desolate forests, of sombre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
fir and yew, the lordly oak and the melancholy
pine, whispering in the breeze. Anon, a green, happy
valley, would smile out from some hollow of the
hills, and the white church-spire would peep from the
embosoming grove, and the rustic parsonage, the rural
farm-house, and the village-inn, with its swinging sign,
and the chestnut waiving its twinkling foliage at the
door would appear. Anon, the shifting vapor would
assume the shape of an old baronial fortress, green
with the mosses of centuries, and overspread with the
flexile creeper, the gadding vine, and the glossy ivy,
and wearing many a dull-weather stain, imprinted by
wintry gale and autumnal rain. On its grey towers
would seem to float the broad standard, around which
the knights and vassals had mustered so often, when
the armies thundered beneath the leagured walls, or
its brave folds were displayed in distant lands, on the
tented fields of war.</p>

<p>Onward, onward! I looked forth, and saw that I
was again wafted along the lower currents of air, and
could easily distinguish the sights and sounds of earth.
I passed over green pastures, where the brindled cattle
and snowy sheep were feeding, and, under a spreading
oak, that towered aloft like a verdant hill, reclined
a young girl, watching her father's flocks, attended by
a pet lamb, cropping the fair flowers at her feet. As
I gazed, I thought of "the fair Una with her milk-white
lamb," and of all the happiness of the shepherd's
life, who, sitting upon the grassy hill-side beneath the
sacred locust, and piping entrancing melodies in praise
of his love, on the mellow oaten reed, is all unmindful
of the cankering care and the poisonous hatred, that
embitter human life. Great was the surprise that agitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that lonesome spot, as mine air-borne pageant
fluttered over it, with its silken fold and colored streamer.
The cattle cast upward their wondering eyes, and
galloped away to the forests, and I could long hear the
tinkling bell on the horn of the bull and heifer, sounding
in the inner sanctuary of the wood, where, on a
twisted root or a moss-covered stone, by the brink of
the gushing brook, reclined that grey-beard recluse,
Solitude, and his nun-like sister, Silence, revolving
their lonely meditations.</p>

<p>Onward, still onward! Beneath me I beheld a solemn
spot, where the linden, the ash, the sycamore, the
cypress, the cedar, the beech, the church-yard yew
and hemlock, were clustered together in one mournful
company. I knew by the stone altars, by the sculptured
urn, the graceful obelisk, the foam-white pyramid,
the funereal cenotaph, the marble mausoleum, which
glimmered amid the groves and bowers, that I looked
upon a sanctuary, consecrated by the living to the repose
of the dead. A sweet sabbath-like calm seemed
to hover about the place, and even the very birds that
were flitting from branch to branch, and the breeze
that was sighing its hollow dirge along the wood-tops,
appeared to know that the spot was holy. As I looked,
I beheld a slow procession winding along this highway
of the departed, and bearing a new tenant to the narrow
house. Some sweet infant, perhaps, was there
cut down in the dewy bloom of its innocence,&mdash;some
beautiful bud of beauty severed from its stem, and
torn away from its blossoming mates, in the garden of
youth,&mdash;or, haply, some silver-haired sire, gathered
like the shock of corn, fully ripe, into the vast granary
of death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>As I passed from this interesting spot, I was attracted
by a merry train of riders, whose loud and cheerful
voices resounded along the road, seeming to mock the
sacred silence of the place I had so lately left. As the
gay array of youth and beauty dashed away from my
sight, with foamy bridle and gory spur, I could not but
be reminded of the close juxta-position on earth, of joy
and sorrow, life and death.</p>

<p>Onward, onward! over winding streams, that glittered
like twisting serpents on the green surface of the
earth, over the broad bay, that rested in smooth and
glassy repose in the arms of the far-extending shore,
and over the dashing billows of the ocean, my route
continued. Birds of the briny sea, whose strong wings
had borne them safely and surely from the frosty atmosphere
that sparkles around the pole, or the ice-cold
waters of some far-away lagoon, now darted around
me with discordant cry and affrighted pinion. In those
hovering flocks I discerned the duck, the goose, the
coot, the loon, the curlew, the green-winged teal, the
dusky duck, the sooty tern, the yellow-winged gadwale,
the golden eye, and the gaudy mallard, proudly vain of
that lovely plumage, whose intense hues rival the glory
of the breaking dawn, the autumnal sunset, or the intermingled
dyes which tinge the stripes of the showery
bow. On an iron-bound promontory, whose jutting
crags waved an eternal strife with the rolling billows,
I saw the thick-scattered cottages of wealth and taste,
seeming no bigger than the nest, which the tropical
bird constructs in the sands of the desert, while around,
on the tumbling expanse of waters, were glancing a
thousand receding and approaching sails, bearing the
riches of the orient or the occident, from shore to shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Downward, downward! A thrill of horror shot
through my veins, as I felt that the rough ocean breeze
had shivered my silken vessel to shreds and tatters, and
that I was falling with the speed of lightning, through
the hollow abyss of the air, into the sea. The jaws of
the fretting ocean, gnashing their white teeth in anger,
seemed to gape open to devour me, and the black
rocks uplifted their jagged spears, to impale my devoted
body! But my time had not yet come. A gentle
tap on the shoulder aroused me from the profound
reverie in which I had been plunged, and I was very
glad to recognize, in the visitor who had broken the
spell, my good friend Durant, who called to invite me
to attend his grand ascension, the following day.</p>

<p>A great multitude were gathered together: on the
right a huge fortress thundering to the sky&mdash;on the left
a scaffold&mdash;a white fog&mdash;the open sea&mdash;and a mighty
ship tumbling to the swell. The flat roofs and gorgeous
balconies were covered with scarlet cloth, and
thronged with women of all ages&mdash;their lips writhing
and their eyes flashing. Underneath were a mute
soldiery, with banners that moved not, and spears that
glimmered not&mdash;a vast, rich and motionless pageant.
Not a leaf stirred&mdash;not a finger was lifted&mdash;all eyes
were fixed upon something afar off. The Grave alone
had a voice, and the footstep of approaching Death
grew audible, with the everlasting beat of the Ocean.
The stagnant atmosphere burned with a lustreless, unchangeable
and smouldering warmth. As the impatient
and sluggish breathing of the Destroyer drew near,
with a sound as of Earthquake and Pestilence laboring
afar off, there appeared upon the outermost verge of
the scaffold, near the fortress, a man of a simple and
majestic presence, wearing no symbol of power, no
badge of authority, before whom the multitude gave
way with headlong precipitation, as though but to touch
the hem of his garment were death itself, or something
yet worse than death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>After communicating with those about him in a low
whisper, too low to be understood by others almost
within his reach, one of the soldiers lifted a spear, at
the point of which fluttered a blood-red banner, tufted and
fringed with snow-white feathers, and pointed in silence
toward a large opening, which appeared to command a
view of the whole interior. The stranger drew near,
and grasping one of the bars with a powerful hand,
lifted himself up, and after looking awhile, turned away
with a sick impatient shudder, and wiped his eyes;
and then lifting himself up again, he made a signal to
somebody within, and straightway a large tent-like
awning was quietly withdrawn, so as to reveal the interior
of a court-yard, with cells opening into it&mdash;in
the nearest of which sat a princely-looking middle-aged
man, half-buried and apparently half asleep
or lost in thought, in a large, heavy, old-fashioned
chair, with a curiously carved table before him, on
which there lay, side by side with writing materials, a
lamp and a letter evidently unfinished, two or three
illuminated manuscripts, a dagger and a map; a massive
goblet richly chased, the rough gold tinged and
sweltering with the hot blood of the southern grape, a
variety of strange mathematical instruments&mdash;a copy
of Zoroaster&mdash;and a Hebrew Bible, with clasps of the
costliest workmanship, and a cover of black velvet frosted
with seed pearls&mdash;a crushed and trampled coronet&mdash;and
a lighted pipe, ornamented with precious stones,
the shaft a twisted serpent and the bowl a burning carbuncle&mdash;a
live coal&mdash;from the core of which, as out of
the midst of a perpetual, unextinguishable fire, issued
a delicate perfume, filling the whole neighborhood, as
with the smoke of a censer; and leaving the eye to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
make out&mdash;by little and little&mdash;through the fragrant vapor,
first a pair of embroidered Persian slippers, then a
magnificent robe, flowered all over as with the sunshine
of the sea, and weltering in the changeable light of the
open window, then a prodigious quantity of lustrous
black hair flowing down over the shoulders, from underneath
a crimson velvet cap with a diamond buckle and
clasp, and a tassel of spun gold, strung with sapphire,
ruby, amethyst and pearl&mdash;and a pomp of black feathers
overshadowing an ample forehead of surpassing power,
and eyes of untroubled splendor; and then, after a long
while, a heap of black shadow lying coiled up underneath
the table, from the midst of which an occasional
flash, as of a serpent's tongue, or an angry sparkle&mdash;as
of a serpent's eye, would appear&mdash;and at last the whole
proportions of a superb-looking personage, who had been
trying, hour after hour, with a compressed lip and a
thoughtful determined eye&mdash;to snap what appeared to
be a handful of seed pearl, one by one, through the
grated window before him, without touching the bars&mdash;hour
after hour&mdash;and always in vain! The passage
way was too narrow&mdash;the bars too near together.</p>

<p>Behold! murmured he at last, while the shadow of
another&mdash;and yet another stranger, shot along the lighted
floor, as he stole about the room a-tiptoe, and gathering
up the pearls, if pearls they were, that lay in heaps
underneath the window, and flinging aside the magnificent
robe he wore, prepared himself anew and with
more determination than ever, for the work he had
evidently set his heart upon, if not his life, by measuring
the elevation with a steadier eye, and poising every
pearl with a more delicate touch, before he projected it
toward the window. Behold! how the Ancient of Days
delighteth in counteracting the purposes of Man?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The other started back and threw up his arms with
a look of horror and amazement, and all who were
about him began whispering together and shaking their
heads.</p>

<p>At this moment the slow jarring vibration of a great
bell was heard from the topmost tower&mdash;the cannon of
the fortress thundered forth, and were answered, peal
after peal, from the lighted mountains&mdash;a volume of
white smoke rolled heavily toward the earth and covered
the people&mdash;the sea-fog trembled&mdash;parted&mdash;and
slowly drifted away in patches and fragments, through
which the blue sky appeared, and the hot sunshine flashed
with an arrowy brightness, while the mighty ship
swung round with her broadside to the shore, and lighted
matches were seen moving about hither and thither,
like wandering meteors, through the damp hazy atmosphere;
and instantly there went up a slow half-smothered
wail from the multitude, with a weight and volume
like the unutterable and growing earnestness of the
Great Deep, when it begins to heave with a pre-appointed
and irresistible change; and all eyes were upturned,
and all arms outstretched with a troubled expression
toward the stranger, who walked forward a few steps
to the verge of the scaffold&mdash;and looking about him,
on every side, called out with a loud voice,&mdash;Of such
are the Gods of the Unconverted! and of such their
followers!</p>

<p>The answering roar of the multitude reached the
prisoner, who lifting his head and listening for a moment
with a placid smile, asked what more they would
have?&mdash;and whether they were not yet satisfied?&mdash;and
then straightway began balancing another of the glittering
seeds and eyeing the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Most pitiable! cried the other, covering his face
with his hands, moving afar off, and appearing to be
entirely overcome by what he saw.</p>

<p>And why <i>pitiable</i>, I pray thee! shouted the former,
with a voice like a trumpet, lifting his calm forehead
to the sky and gathering his magnificent robe about
him as he spoke.</p>

<p>Art thou of a truth Adonijah the Jew&mdash;the unconverted
Jew?</p>

<p>Of a truth am I&mdash;the unconverted, the <i>unconvertable</i>
Jew; and thou! art thou not he that was my brother
according to the flesh&mdash;even Zorobabel, the <i>converted</i>
Jew and the preacher of a new faith?</p>

<p>Yea; of a new faith to such as thou; but a faith
older than the Hebrew prophets to them that believe,
Adonijah.</p>

<p>But why <i>pitiable</i> I pray thee?</p>

<p>How are the mighty fallen! For three whole months
have I journied afoot and alone, by night and by day,
through the deep of the wilderness, and along by the
sea-shore&mdash;afoot and alone, my brother!&mdash;after hearing
of thy great overthrow&mdash;the wreck of thy vast possessions
about me whithersoever I went&mdash;thy magnificent
household scattered, thy princes banished from
their high places, and wandering over all the earth and
hiding themselves in the holes of the rocks&mdash;with no
city of refuge in their path&mdash;even thy youngest and
fairest a bondwoman, toiling for that which sustaineth
not; and thy own fast-approaching death, a theme with
every people and kindred and tongue&mdash;and not a theme
of sorrow! And all this, O my brother and my prince!
only that I might be near thee in thy unutterable bereavement
and humiliation, only that I might look upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
thee once more alive, and see thee unchangeable as
ever, though stripped of power and trampled under the
hoofs of the multitude&mdash;only that I might reason with
thee, face to face, before a great people, who, after
watching and worshipping thee for many years, have
come up together as with one heart, to see thee&mdash;<i>thee!</i>
their idol and their benefactor&mdash;perish upon a scaffold,
as only the fool or the scoffer perisheth!&mdash;to cry out
upon thee as the unconquerable Jew, that having once
abjured the faith of his fathers and gone back to it anew,
cannot be reached but by the law, nor purified but
with fire!</p>

<p>Say on.</p>

<p>Alas, my brother! Alas that it should fall upon me to
afflict thy proud spirit with reproaches at a time like
this! But there is no other hope. Awake, therefore!
awake! and gird up thy loins like a man. I will demand
of thee, saith the Lord of Hosts, and thou shalt
answer me, even as my servant Job answered me of
yore. Awake, therefore, and stand up, that I may
reason with thee for the last time touching the faith of
our mighty fathers, the consolations of philosophy, and
the splendor and power of earthly Wisdom&mdash;of Death
and Judgment&mdash;while thou art on thy way to the grave
in the fulness of thy strength and majesty; and <i>not</i>
with the clangor of trumpets, the neigh of steeds, the
flow of drapery, and the uproar of battle!&mdash;No!&mdash;not
as the High Priest, or the champion of a lofty and venerable
faith, standing up like a pillar of fire in a cloudy
sky, and pointing to Jerusalem as to the great gathering
place of buried nations, about to reappear, with all eyes
fixed upon thee and all hearts heaving with exultation!
To thy grave, my brother! and not as a martyr! but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
as a wretch abandoned of all the earth&mdash;a twofold
apostate!&mdash;a rebel and a traitor! Hark! hearest thou
not a faint stirring afar off, along the shore of that multitude&mdash;a
living wilderness of threatening eyes and
parched lips&mdash;and ah! another moan from that huge,
heavy, disheartening bell, which never stops till the
sacrifice of a fiery death is over, and the object of its
boding prophecy gone to the world of spirits.</p>

<p>But the prisoner heeded not his adjuration&mdash;he never
lifted his eyes, and the same quiet smile rested forever
upon his countenance; and he still gathered up the
pearls and continued aiming them at the window.</p>

<p>Awake, Adonijah! awake, I say! Thy pearls are
counted to thee. Thy pulses are about to stand still
forever&mdash;thy proud heart to stop forever! A moment,
and the headsman will be here&mdash;already do I see him
afar off, stealing with a noiseless movement along the
skirts of the affrighted people, like smouldering fire
through the blackness of a thunder-cloud. Awake,
thou <span class="smcap">man</span> of sorrow and acquainted with grief, awake
that I may pray with thee!</p>

<p>With me!</p>

<p>Yea, my brother&mdash;even with thee.</p>

<p>And wherefore shouldst thou pray with me? and
wherefore should I pray?</p>

<p>Wherefore! Have I not heard thee, purified by that
old peculiar faith, charge even thy Creator, the Ancient
of Days, the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, <i>Jehovah!</i>
with diverting thy pearls from their appointed path!</p>

<p>True, and therefore why should I pray? Of what
avail these prayers with the <i>unchangeable</i> God? Can
aught that we do, or fail to do, disturb the everlasting
tranquillity of our Creator&mdash;change his purpose&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in any way move to pleasure or displeasure the Lord
God of Heaven and Earth? With him before whom
all things are alike, with whom there is neither great
nor small&mdash;what he hath determined to do, that will
he not do? whether we importune him or not with
prayer? Go to, my poor brother! go to! will not the
Judge of all the Earth do right? and if he will not&mdash;how
are we to help ourselves?</p>

<p>Unhappy man! Though he <i>were</i> unchangeable;
and though supplications were of no avail, why should
the children of men, the creatures of his bounty withhold
their <i>thanksgiving</i>?</p>

<p>That would I never withhold, for that I could offer
up any where&mdash;at all times and under all circumstances,
without dishonoring him, our <span class="smcap">Creator</span> and our
Father, or his image, and without contradicting our
ancient faith. But why wrestle in prayer with him,
for that which, if it be proper for us, we shall be sure to
have, as we have the dew and the sunshine, the seed-time
and the harvest.&mdash;The very hairs of our head, are
they not numbered? Are not five sparrows sold for
two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before
God!</p>

<p>Yea my brother! But what saith the same scripture?
Ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>

<p>True&mdash;true&mdash;I had forgotten a part of my lesson.</p>

<p>Believest thou, O my brother, <i>canst</i> thou believe
then, that in His eyes, all the cherubim and seraphim
are equal and alike? that He is, of a truth, no respecter
of persons among the Hierarchy of heaven?</p>

<p>But wherefore pray to Him that knoweth all our
wants, before they are uttered or felt? to Him that
feedeth the young raven&mdash;laying his hand reverentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
upon the Great Book before him, and lifting his forehead
to the sky, as if he could see through it.</p>

<p><i>Wherefore?</i> Because we have been urged to pray&mdash;entreated
to pray&mdash;commanded to pray. Because
every thing desirable hath been promised to prayer.</p>

<p>Not in the Hebrew scriptures, however it may be
with the Greek. To thanksgiving and submission, there
may be vouchsafed a continual to favor; but to importunity,
as urged upon you in your scripture, my poor
brother, <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p>Lo! the headsman touches the foot of the scaffold!
Wilt thou not pray with me, oh Adonijah! my brother
and my prince!</p>

<p>No! my brother that <i>was</i>&mdash;no! The Lion of Judah
hath not yet learned to lick the uplifted hand of mortal
man. Get thee behind me Zorobabel, <i>my brother</i>!
Go thy way, and leave me to my trust in the God of
our fathers. Why should I pray with thee&mdash;with thee!
an apostate from the sepulchre of kings and prophets&mdash;I
that never have prayed but with the princes, and the
Judges and the High-Priest of our people? Get thee
gone, my brother! It is not for such as I to tempt the
Lord of Hosts, or to persuade the Ancient of Days.
Do not thou tempt me.</p>

<p>Stay, brother&mdash;stay! Did not Jacob wrestle in
prayer with the angel of the Lord, all the night long?</p>

<p>With the angel of the Lord?&mdash;yea&mdash;But never with
the Lord himself, as thou wouldst have me. And saying
this, he gathered up his robe and shook it, and
turned away from his brother sorrowing.</p>

<p>Man! thou art beside thyself&mdash;much learning hath
made thee mad&mdash;cried his brother, reaching forth his
arms to Adonijah. The whole Hebrew scriptures are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
against thee&mdash;what are they all but a Book of prayer
and supplication? Prophets and Bards and Kings and
Judges, yea, even the High Priesthood, are against
thee! Why shouldst thou pray, thou unconquerable
Hebrew?&mdash;why!&mdash;that thy proud heart may be made
human&mdash;that thy understanding may be enlightened&mdash;that
thou mayst be made to know and believe that there
is another and a better Scripture. Pray to thy Father,
which is in Heaven, as thou wouldst that thy children
should pray to thee, even for that which thou hast already
determined to grant them&mdash;oh, pray to Him! that
He may see the disposition of thy heart, as thou wouldst
see theirs. What though thou art mindful of their
wants, and well acquainted with their hearts and purposes,
and always ready to gratify them, is it not a
condition with thee&mdash;even with <i>thee</i>, Adonijah, that
they should acknowledge their dependence upon thee,
and their utter helplessness of themselves? And why
should it not be so with our Heavenly Father? with
Him whose angels are about thee and above thee, a
perpetual atmosphere of warmth and light. Ha! the
multitude are breaking up!&mdash;they are coming this way!
I hear the tramp of horsemen&mdash;a moment more and
we are apart forever. A flash!&mdash;The Philistines are
upon thee, O my brother!</p>

<p>That brother looked up and smiled.</p>

<p>Wilt thou not pray with me?</p>

<p>No&mdash;once for all&mdash;no! Never with a converted
Jew&mdash;never with a christian!&mdash;never with thee, thou
but half a christian!</p>

<p>Farewell then!&mdash;farewell forever.</p>

<p>Another flash! attended with a loud burst of thunder
among the hills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Nay, let us part in peace, my brother, although I
cannot pray with thee, I can for thee! The God of
our Fathers! of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, have thee
in his holy keeping!</p>

<p>The stranger threw up his arms in a transport of joy.
The unconverted, the <i>unconvertable</i> Jew had prayed
for him with the temper of a christian; and straightway
he fell upon his knees and called upon the God of
the Hebrews, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
to spare the Jew and change his heart.</p>

<p>The huge gate swung open. The drawbridge fell&mdash;a
fierce angry light broke forth suddenly from underneath
the scaffold&mdash;a black banner floated all at once
from the battlements over the passage-way&mdash;a troop
of horsemen, with flashing spears and iron helmets,
wheeled slowly into the court-yard, and drew up in dead
silence along the outer barrier. The headsman appeared.
A signal was made from a far window, and
lo! the coronet and the robe, with all the glittering insignia
of departed power and extinguished glory, were
torn away, and trampled under foot by the hoofs of the
multitude. A white smoke rolled forth from below,
and when it cleared away, the Jew appeared standing
bareheaded between two gigantic mutes, one of whom
bore a naked cimetar, while the other stood watching
his countenance. It continued unaltered&mdash;unalterable&mdash;nor
would he vouchsafe the slightest token of
submission or terror, though the flames roared, and the
white smoke rolled thitherward like the white sea-fog
before a coming storm; but haughtily, steadfastly, and
with a majestic mildness which awed the very soldiery
more than all the pomp they were accustomed to, he
pointed to the multitude, lowering about him with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
tempestuous blackness&mdash;to the pyre with its covering
of blood-red cloth dripping with recent moisture&mdash;to
the flames roaring far below among the dry faggots,
and signified a wish to proceed.</p>

<p>Once more shouted a voice from the barrier&mdash;My
brother! oh my brother! wilt thou not be prevailed
upon, if not for thine own sake, for the sake of thy beloved
wife and thy youngest born&mdash;about to perish with
thee&mdash;even with thee, my brother, in their marvellous
beauty and most abundant strength.</p>

<p>Away!&mdash;and let me die in peace!</p>

<p>Another step thou unconquerable man! But another
step&mdash;thou apostate Jew!&mdash;and thou art in the
world of spirits! Wilt thou not say? <i>canst</i> thou not,
with lowliness and fervor, Our Father which art in
Heaven! thy will and not mine be done!</p>

<p>Yea, brother&mdash;if that will comfort thee in thy desolation.
Yea! Yea! with all the hoarded and concentrated
fervor of a long life accustomed to no other language,
even while I took upon me the outer garb of a
christian&mdash;Yea!&mdash;and saying this, he fell upon his
knees, and cried out with a loud voice, while a triumphant
brightness overspread his uplifted countenance
with a visible exaltation, Our Father and our Judge!
I do not pray to thee as the God of the christians
did, that this cup may be spared to me; for I have put
my whole hope and trust in thee, and am satisfied with
whatsoever I may receive at thy hands! But I would
bless thee, I would praise thee, I would magnify thy
great name, oh God of my Fathers, for all that I have
enjoyed or suffered, for all that I have had or wanted
in this life; yea, for all the afflictions and sorrows and
terrors that have beset my path, and that of my beloved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
wife and my dear children&mdash;children of the tribe of
Judah and of the house of Jacob!&mdash;Yea, for the overthrow
of all my proud hopes and prouder wishes, when
I forsook thee and almost abjured the faith of my Fathers
for dominion sake. Forgive my apostate brother,
I beseech thee, O Lord! as thou hast forgiven me:
and bless the heritage of thy people, and encourage
them as the followers of the new faith are encouraged
by their Jesus of Nazareth, to forgive their enemies,
even though their enemies take the shape of a beloved
friend or brother&mdash;to betray them&mdash;giving up their
birth-right, like Esau for a mess of pottage.</p>

<p>A great commotion appeared on the house-tops, extending
itself slowly far and wide.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, continued the Jew&mdash;nevertheless! oh
Father and Judge, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob!
thy will and not mine be done!</p>

<p>The multitude began to surge this way and that,
with exceeding violence. A cry of indignation arose
from every side. A tumult followed&mdash;a general rush&mdash;the
house-tops were suddenly deserted&mdash;the sea shore&mdash;and
some began shouting, Away with him! away with
him! and others, Let the blaspheming Jew perish without
hope! and others, Crucify him! crucify him!</p>

<p>But in the midst of the uproar, one clear solitary cry
was heard afar off, repeating a prayer to the God of
the Hebrews&mdash;another cloud of white smoke rolled
over the battlements&mdash;the flames appeared half way up
the sky&mdash;a trumpet sounded underneath the very scaffold&mdash;the
ancient war-cry of the Jews, <i>To your tents,
O Israel!</i> rung far and wide along the outer barrier&mdash;up
sprang a multitude of small white banners, like affrighted
birds, from the midst of the people&mdash;and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
next moment, before they had recovered from their unspeakable
consternation, the heavy horsemen charged
upon them in a body, the great ship swung round with
all her voices thundering together, and swept their pathway
as with a whirlwind of fire, while they hurried
hither and thither, crying To arms! to arms! The
Jews! the Jews! and pointing toward the bridge, only
to find the bridge itself destroyed and the opposite
shore in possession of that other converted Jew&mdash;the
stranger!&mdash;all in glittering steel arrayed, and carrying
a banner on which the Lion of Judah was ramping in a
field of carnage!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And when the Jew Adonijah, now more a Jew than
ever, and more fully satisfied than ever, with the sublime,
and awful, and unchangeable faith of his old
Hebrew Fathers, came fully to himself, and the tumult
was all over, he found three out of his four children
of the house of Jacob, standing near him in their robes
of state&mdash;another, and a stranger, harnessed for the
war, his black eyes yet gleaming with the half-extinguished
fire of battle, standing at the door of the chamber.</p>

<p>And why wouldst thou not pray for us, father? said
one of the two that were standing by the bed-side.</p>

<p>Because ye were sick unto death; and I held it sinful
to ask for that which had been refused to King
David himself&mdash;I, that had forsaken the Lord God of
my fathers&mdash;How could I hope that he would not forsake
me!</p>

<p>But the christian prayed for us, Father, and the
prayers of the christian were heard!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>With what face could they, <i>being christians</i>, pray
for the children of men that put their Savior to death?
How could they, <i>being christians</i>, forget their scripture,
which saith&mdash;<i>suffer little children to come unto me, and
forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of heaven!</i></p>

<p>And as he spoke, the great doors were thrown open,
and the armed man flung down his helmet, and walked
forward with a solemn and haughty step leading a
beautiful woman captive, and a young child.</p>

<p>A shriek!&mdash;a tumult!&mdash;and straightway all were
kneeling together! And not one of that family of Jacob&mdash;that
remnant of the tribe of Judah&mdash;not one was
missing. They were determined to live and die in their
old august unchangeable faith, even as all their progenitors
had lived and died&mdash;enduring all things&mdash;suffering
all things&mdash;trials and sorrows and temptations&mdash;age
after age&mdash;and never betraying their faith, never!</p>

<p>But the unconquerable Jew acknowledged to himself,
and to his brother, even there, as they fell upon his
neck and wept, the <i>possibility</i> of prayer being heard,
the <i>possibility</i> that the unchangeable God might be
reached by supplication&mdash;and the <i>possibility</i> that even
a philosopher and a Jew might be mistaken.</p>

<p>But&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="MUSINGS_ON_MUSIC" id="MUSINGS_ON_MUSIC"></a>MUSINGS ON MUSIC.</h2>

<h3>By James F. Otis.</h3>

<div class="center">And while I was musing, the fire burned.&mdash;<i>Holy Writ.</i></div>
<div class="bigskip"></div>

<div class="center">THE ORIGIN OF MUSIC.</div>

<p>Music is the wondrous breathing of God's spirit in our
souls. As we view the "floor of heaven, thickly inlaid
with patines of pure gold," we feel that</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's not the smallest orb which we behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, in its motion, like an angel sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still quiring to the young eyed cherubim.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We feel it in the constitution of the air, which causes
vibration&mdash;in the formation of man, possessed of the
wonderful faculties enabling him to sing, to distinguish
musical sounds, and to feel within his whole frame the
effects of music. Man, indeed, is himself a wonderful
musical instrument, made by the hand of God. He
hears all nature hymning adoration and praises to its
Maker&mdash;he feels the constant vibration of universal
harmony around him&mdash;he is conscious that the emotions
of gratitude he feels toward the Creator should be
expressed, and that in the highest strains which the
human mind can conceive, and the human voice can
reach. Thus he calls in to his aid all those auxiliaries
which nature and art afford, to supply him with associations
tending to elevate the standard of his grateful
expressions. Music is a sacred, a religious, a <i>holy</i>
thing. Applied to common purposes, it is pleasing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
worthy of cultivation&mdash;but still it has a higher character
when used for its original and more worthy purpose.
The effect it produces in the former instance
is to raise our <i>mirth</i>:&mdash;when used in its higher character,
its effect is to produce <i>rapture</i>. It soothes when
thus employed, as of old it did when David banished
the evil spirit from the soul of Saul by the vibrations of
his sweet-toned harp; it improves&mdash;as all good influences
and pure associations ever must, when permitted
their due action upon the mind; and it elevates the
spirit toward the eternal source whence all its harmony
flows. As it peals upon the ear, and sinks inly upon
the heart of him whose mind is bent upon the
thoughts of holy things&mdash;upon his creation, his present
blessings and future hopes, he seems to hear</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That undisturbed song of pure content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye sung around the sapphire-colored throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him that sits thereon&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the bright seraphim, in burning row,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their loud, uplifted angel trumpets blow;<br /></span>

<div class="center">HANDEL AND HAYDN. THE MESSIAH AND THE CREATION,
A PARABLE.</div>

<p>Handel, with all his comparative simplicity, is my favorite.
I cannot but look up to him with astonishment
and veneration; his "Messiah," I behold as the purest
specimen of sublimity ever displayed in the arts: and
I can conceive of nothing in poetry with any pretension
to be considered its parallel, but the "Paradise
Lost" of Milton. The "Hallelujah Chorus" may
be esteemed the loftiest work of the imagination. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
leading conception is entirely inimitable. The full
chorus of other masters is often bold and elevated; but
it is only Handel who has the sublime of devotion.
Haydn is triumphant and inspiring; but the effect of
his chorus is only that of martial music. In listening
to Haydn, you seem to hear the shouts of conquerors,
proudly entering a vanquished city: in listening to
Handel, the shouts seem to break from the clouds;
from the triumphant host admitted to the presence of
God; and the object of praise gives a character of holiness
and purity to the harmony. With Haydn,
we exult, we reason not why. With Handel, we
can never for a moment forget that we are praising
God. The rapid movements and quick transitions of
Haydn draw the fullest admiration to the orchestra,
and the subject is forgotten. The lighter passages in
Handel are only the varied note of praise, expanding
only in proportion to the inspiration which the object
kindles. In one word,&mdash;every thing in Haydn is seen
to be accomplished; and every delineation, if I may
thus employ the word, is felt to be a resemblance.
But in Handel, let what will be described or exhibited,&mdash;a
battle,&mdash;a victory,&mdash;the trembling of the earth,&mdash;the
tottering of a wall,&mdash;the moan of sympathy,&mdash;the
insults and crucifixion of a Savior,&mdash;the awful stillness
of death,&mdash;or, on the other hand, the triumph of the
resurrection,&mdash;the birth of the Prince of Peace,&mdash;or
hosannas to the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,&mdash;every
thing seems to be done at the command of God
himself.</p>

<p>But I conceive it is not difficult to reconcile an admiration
of both these great masters, in as much as
their music presents such a variety only as every art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
admits. Claude Loraine was no rival of Raphael&mdash;yet
we stand with one before a landscape, and with
the other at the foot of the cross, with like, if not
equal astonishment and admiration. The recitatives
of Haydn are, with scarcely a single exception, less
bold, but better finished,&mdash;less abrupt, and better calculated
for the scope of the voice, than those of
Handel; and are supported by a harmony more graceful,
though not more striking and natural. Haydn, at
all times, threw the fascination of melody over his
richest modulations, and the whole effect of his harmony
resulted from conspiring airs, each of which was
melodious by itself. While, on the other hand, the
separate parts in Handel were like single pillars from
a temple, or single stones from a pyramid. If, in
Handel, appear the beauty of consistency,&mdash;in Haydn
we admire the consistency of beauty. If Handel's
choruses and harmony might be compared, both in
their formation and beauty, to mountains of ice, illuminated
by the sun,&mdash;Haydn's harmony would seem
to resemble the most splendid crystalizations&mdash;under
the same illumination, in which one form of beauty
has gradually encircled another, until the shape and
beauty of the minutest part has become imparted to
the larger proportions, and more commanding figure
of the whole mass. It is impossible indeed, to find
any thing in music,&mdash;placing his choruses out of view,&mdash;which
can rival the sublime recitative of Handel,&mdash;"For
behold darkness shall cover the earth,&mdash;but the
Lord shall arise!"&mdash;Yet the opening of Haydn's "Creation,"
may deserve to be ranked second only to this,
and as surpassing every other attempt of its author, in
sublimity, and deep, solemn grandeur. The fall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the angels, in the first part of the same noble oratorio,
is a wonderful effort, and presents the most remarkable
instance in all Haydn's compositions, of the characteristic
excellence which has just been ascribed to him,
namely, his uniform regard to his melody, even where
he designed to produce the boldest effect in his harmony.
It is the most graphic musical description ever
attempted; and it must have been produced in one of
those moments of lofty enthusiasm in which a conception
of surpassing grandeur flashes upon the mind, is
grasped and embodied in an instant, and a man pauses
in exultation and astonishment at what he has himself
accomplished. This passage, however,&mdash;if it had no
other excellence,&mdash;could never be forgotten, as it
gives the most striking effect to the inimitable contrast
which succeeds,&mdash;where the first impression of the
beauty of the world at the moment of the creation is
described with such tenderness and grace, that the
most vulgar minds, as well as those whose taste has
been in some degree refined, have felt every note, as
it came from the forms of living things, exulting
in their existence&mdash;or as if the author had borrowed
the lyre of the morning stars, that sang the glories of
the "new created world."&mdash;The celebrated chorus,
"The Heavens are telling the glory of God," is unquestionably
the boldest conception of Haydn. Its
harmony has the most astonishing richness and variety,
and the leading air is almost unexceptionably beautiful.
Yet it may be called a chorus in theory only; for it
requires the fullest choir of the finest voices and most
refined tastes,&mdash;and no community of any country can
furnish a hundred and fifty singers, capable of performing
it, even with a tolerable degree of spirit, judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and correctness. By this remark I mean merely, that
the original conception of the author, and that with
which every one who feels its true beauty and force is
filled, upon studying, or hearing it,&mdash;can never be fully
realized and carried out, and filled up, by the finest
combination of human powers.</p>

<p>There have not been wanting writers upon the beautiful
in music, who have denounced what they are pleased
to call attempts at picturesque, in the "Creation"
of Haydn. Their arguments proceed upon the trifling
nature of the results produced by imitations, as unworthy
the dignity of an art so refined. The feelings
awakened by the gradual developement of the work of
creation in this immortal work are certainly far superior
in their nature to those imputed by such writers to
the admirers of what they call depictive music;&mdash;and
I cannot believe that these objectors can have listened
to the oratorio they criticise, either with the physical
or rational ear. Had they, we should have heard
nothing like an imputation of an unsuccessful imitation
of trifling originals. They would have seen no other
use of the musical picturesque than perfectly consists
with true descriptiveness of the subject celebrated.
The Creation is a grand panorama; its object was to
impress the hearer with the realities it commemorates.
Its author was engaged two whole years upon it, and
gave as a reason for his absorption in the task, that he
meant it to last a great while. He has composed a
work which addresses itself to the mind in such a manner,
as to call up to the eye the landscape, as well as
to the ear the sounds, and to the conception the animation
and motion of the scenes described. Surely a
beautiful thought, a fine description, an impassioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sentiment, impressed upon the mind and memory by a
strong association with almost all the senses at once,
are more likely to become inseparably entwined among
the very fibres of the heart, than a cold, abstract description
of the same subject, without the intervention
of such associations. I should pity the man who could
utter such a criticism, while listening to the performance,
or even reading the score of this most splendid
oratorio. From the commencement,&mdash;conveying the
idea of primeval chaos,&mdash;through the gradual gathering
of the earth and sea, and the things which each
contains, into their several places,&mdash;the budding and
blooming of the thousand flowers,&mdash;the cooing of the
tender doves,&mdash;the trampling of the heavy beasts,&mdash;the
flowing of the gentle rills,&mdash;the rolling of the
mountain waves,&mdash;the bursting of light at the Creator's
word,&mdash;angels praising God,&mdash;the noble work of man's
creation,&mdash;the achievement of the whole,&mdash;up to the
last grand and glorious chorus,&mdash;all is sublimity&mdash;all
is divine! and the whole soul of the auditor is wrapt in
sacred awe, as he follows the beneficent hand of his
Maker in its wonderful work, and is lost in rapture and
adoration, amid the blaze of glory by which he finds
himself surrounded at the close.</p>

<div class="center">SOME THOUGHTS ON OPERATIVE MUSIC.</div>

<p>There are those who institute a comparison between
music and poetry, and much to the prejudice of the
former. They argue that the intellect has nothing to
do with music, and that it is ridiculous and absurd in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
those who speak no Italian, to pretend to derive any
satisfaction from listening, for two hours, to music in a
language they cannot understand&mdash;affecting, at the
same time, to comprehend the sense to be conveyed,
by the sounds they drink in with such assumed rapture.
I conceive this to be far from just reasoning. Doubtless
there is a great deal of affectation in the fashionable
world upon the subject of music in general, and of
the opera in particular; but we have no right to judge
our neighbor's taste by our own&mdash;perhaps, after all, it
may turn out that our own is defective or false. I am
inclined to argue that the intellect has as much to do
with music as with poetry.</p>

<p>In judging of pieces adapted to music, we should be
lenient on the subject of the thoughts, if the design and
story have variety enough to afford a basis for a corresponding
variety of musical ideas. The most common
expression of any passion may be tolerated, when
the music, <i>not</i> the poetry, is to form the embellishment.
Who cares for the story&mdash;the plot&mdash;in listening to the
Italian opera? Nay, more&mdash;are not the finest and
most beautiful pieces of that class of music, vulgar and
weak as poetical compositions? Is not the musical composer
the genius of the piece? While the poet utters
some such trash as 'I shall support myself by feasting
on your beautiful eyes,' the composer so varies the
expression of his music, that, in truth, the thought
becomes refined, just as it would if the poet had undertaken
to present it in a variety of views. To say,
therefore, that the repetitions in music are nonsense, is
just to profess a deplorable ignorance of the science.
The words convey a sentiment which the musician
undertakes to increase&mdash;to soften&mdash;to embellish, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
a series of fine ideas, of which those who have neither
musical taste nor ear have not the least conception.</p>

<p>Nor should it be supposed that, in the opera&mdash;in the
fine pieces of Metastasio, for instance&mdash;the poetry is
disgraced by being but the handmaid of music, and
that the former is therefore reduced unduly in the scale
of comparative merit. This is not the case with him
who is an equal admirer of the two arts. Such as
these will admit that it is but in a very small degree
that music is designed to please a sense. They will
insist that its design is to excite emotions that poetry,
to the same extent, cannot awaken. What speech in
the whole Iliad rouses more exulting courage than the
'Marsellois Hymn?' The music of 'Pleyel's German
Hymn' not only of itself produces an effect to awaken
a feeling of grief, but no words that I have ever read
are capable of producing that feeling in an equal degree.
Take for example, the lamentation of David for
the loss of Absalom&mdash;and if that passage, and others
like it, are enough to melt or break the heart, there is
a kind of music, of which 'Pleyel's Hymn' is an
example, that will affect it more deeply yet.</p>

<p>Words, considered as auxiliary to music, merely
show the subject on which the emotion rests, but have
nothing to do with the emotion itself; <i>that</i> is produced
by music alone&mdash;and long before any words are known
to an air, the emotion will have been produced. We
shall have imagined the subject&mdash;and when we come
to know the words, we shall discover one of three
things: first, that the subject is what we imagined&mdash;secondly,
that it is something analogous to our perception&mdash;or,
thirdly, if neither of the two former, that the
words and air are ill-adapted to each other. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
what do we mean by saying, 'these words are adapted
to the air,' if the air have no character of its own?
And what is its character but its peculiar power of
awakening certain emotions? Admitting that it is
better that fine poetry and fine harmony should be
united, when possible&mdash;and that this union, of course,
produces additional delight to a refined mind,&mdash;it still
seems to me very absurd to condemn the pieces which
are constructed upon ideas conveyed in poetry of an
inferior class, <i>merely because such is the character of
the poetry</i>. Music is the governor of the heart, and all
she asks of Poetry is a subject,&mdash;and then, delightful
magician! it is her province to call up, by her sweet
spell, the corresponding emotions!</p>

<h2><a name="SIN_ESTIMATED_BY_THE_LIGHT_OF_HEAVEN" id="SIN_ESTIMATED_BY_THE_LIGHT_OF_HEAVEN"></a>SIN ESTIMATED BY THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN.</h2>

<h3>By Edward Payson.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</i></div>


<p>It is a well known fact that the appearance of objects,
and the ideas which we form of them, are very much
affected by the situation in which they are placed with
respect to us, and by the light in which they are seen.
Objects seen at a distance, for example, appear much
smaller than they really are. The same object, viewed
through different mediums, will often exhibit very different
appearances. A lighted candle, or a star, appears
bright during the absence of the sun; but when
that luminary returns, their brightness is eclipsed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Since the appearance of objects, and the ideas which
we form of them, are thus affected by extraneous circumstances,
it follows, that no two persons will form
precisely the same ideas of any object, unless they
view it in the same light, or are placed with respect to
it in the same situation.</p>

<p>These remarks have a direct and important bearing
upon our subject. No person can read the scriptures
candidly and attentively, without perceiving that God
and men differ, very widely, in the opinion which they
entertain respecting almost every object. And in nothing
do they differ more widely, than in the estimate
they form of man's moral character, and of the malignity
and desert of sin. Nothing can be more evident
than the fact, that, in the sight of God, our sins are
incomparably more numerous, aggravated and criminal,
than they appear to us. He regards us as deserving
of an endless punishment, while we scarcely perceive
that we deserve any punishment at all. Now whence
arises this difference? The remarks which have just
been made will inform us. God and men view objects
through a very different medium, and are placed, with
respect to them, in a very different situation. God is
present with every object; he views it as near and
therefore sees its real magnitude. But many objects,
especially those of a religious nature, are seen by us
at a distance, and, of course, appear to us smaller than
they really are. God sees every object in a perfectly
clear light; but we see most objects dimly and indistinctly.
In fine, God sees all objects just as they are;
but we see them through a deceitful medium, which
ignorance, prejudice and self-love place between them
and us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The Psalmist, addressing God, says, thou hast set
our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of
thy countenance, that is, our iniquities or open transgressions,
and our secret sins, the sins of our hearts,
are placed, as it were, full before God's face, immediately
under his eye; and he sees them in the pure,
clear, all-disclosing light of his own holiness and glory.
Now if we would see our sins as they appear to him,
that is, as they really are; if we would see their number,
blackness and criminality, and the malignity and
desert of every sin, we must place ourselves, as nearly
as is possible, in his situation, and look at sin, as it
were, through his eyes. We must place ourselves and
our sins in the centre of that circle, which is irradiated
by the light of his countenance; where all his infinite
perfections are clearly displayed, where his awful
majesty is seen, where his concentrated glories blaze,
and burn, and dazzle, with insufferable brightness; and
in order to this, we must, in thought, leave our dark
and sinful world, where God is unseen and almost forgotten,
and where, consequently, the evil of sinning
against him cannot be fully perceived&mdash;and mount up
to heaven, the peculiar habitation of his holiness and
glory.</p>

<p>Let us, then, attempt this adventurous flight. Let
us follow the path by which our blessed Savior ascended
to heaven, and soar upward to the great capital of
the universe; to the palace and the throne of its greater
King. As we rise, the earth fades away from our
view; now we leave worlds, and suns, and systems
behind us. Now we reach the utmost limits of creation;
now the last star disappears, and no ray of created
light is seen. But a new light begins to dawn and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
brighten upon us. It is the light of heaven, which
pours a flood of glory from its wide-open gates, spreading
continual, meridian day, far and wide through the
regions of ethereal space. Passing swiftly onward
through this flood of day, the songs of heaven begin to
burst upon your ears, and voices of celestial sweetness,
yet loud as the sound of many waters and of mighty
thunderings, are heard exclaiming, Hallelujah! for the
Lord God omnipotent reigneth! Blessing, and glory,
and honor, and power, be unto Him that sitteth on the
throne, and to the Lamb, forever. A moment more,
and you have passed the gates&mdash;you are in the midst
of the city&mdash;you are before the eternal throne&mdash;you
are in the immediate presence of God, and all his glories
are blazing around you like a consuming fire. Flesh
and blood cannot support it; your bodies dissolve into
their original dust; but your immortal souls remain,
and stand naked spirits before the great Father of spirits.
Nor, in losing their tenements of clay, have they lost
their powers of perception. No; they are now all eye,
all ear; nor can you close the eyelids of the soul, to
shut out, for a moment, the dazzling, overpowering
splendors which surround you, and which appear like
light condensed; like glory which may be felt. You
see indeed no form or shape; and yet your whole souls
perceive with intuitive clearness and certainty, the immediate,
awe-inspiring presence of Jehovah. You see
no countenance; and yet you feel as if a countenance
of awful majesty, in which all the perfections of divinity
are shown forth, were beaming upon you wherever
you turn. You see no eye; and yet a piercing, heart-searching
eye, an eye of omniscient purity, every
glance of which goes through your souls like a flash of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
lightning, seems to look upon you from every point of
surrounding space. You feel as if enveloped in an
atmosphere, or plunged in an ocean of existence, intelligence,
perfection and glory; an ocean of which
your laboring minds can take in only a drop; an ocean,
the depth of which you cannot fathom, and the breadth
of which you can never fully explore. But while you
feel utterly unable to comprehend this infinite Being,
your views of him, so far as they extend, are perfectly
clear and distinct. You have the most vivid perceptions,
the most deeply graven impressions, of an infinite,
eternal, spotless mind; in which the image of all
things, past, present and to come, are most harmoniously
seen, arranged in the most perfect order, and
defined with the nicest accuracy; of a mind, which
wills with infinite ease, but whose volitions are attended
by a power omnipotent and irresistible, and which
sows worlds, suns and systems through the fields of
space with far more facility, than the husbandman
scatters his seed upon the earth; of a mind, whence
have flowed all the streams, which ever watered any
part of the universe with life, intelligence, holiness, or
happiness, and which is still fully overflowing and inexhaustible.
You perceive also, with equal clearness
and certainty, that this infinite, eternal, omnipotent,
omniscient, all-wise, all-creating mind is perfectly and
essentially holy, a pure flame of holiness; and that, as
such, he regards sin with unutterable, irreconcilable
detestation and abhorrence. With a voice, which reverberates
through the wide expanse of his dominions,
you hear him saying, as the Sovereign and Legislator
of the universe, Be ye holy; for I, the Lord your God,
am holy. And you see his throne surrounded, you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
heaven filled by those only, who perfectly obey this
command. You see thousands of thousands, and ten
thousand times ten thousand of angels and archangels,
pure, exalted, glorious intelligences, who reflect his perfect
image, burn like flames of fire with zeal for his
glory, and seem to be so many concentrations of wisdom,
knowledge, holiness and love; a fit retinue for
the thrice holy Lord of hosts, whose holiness and all-filling
glory they unceasingly proclaim.</p>

<p>And now, if you are willing to see your sins in their
true colors; if you would rightly estimate their number,
magnitude and criminality, bring them into this
hallowed place, where nothing is seen but the whiteness
of unsullied purity, and the splendors of uncreated
glory; where the sun itself would appear a dark spot,
and there, in the midst of this circle of seraphic intelligences,
with the infinite God pouring all the light of
his countenance around you, review your lives, contemplate
your offences, and see how they appear.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WAY_OF_THE_SOUL" id="THE_WAY_OF_THE_SOUL"></a>THE WAY OF THE SOUL.</h2>

<h3>By L. S. P.</h3>


<p>There is a homely proverb which tells us that "the
longest way round is the shortest way home." Whether
the mathematical demonstration of so paradoxical an
assertion would be easy or difficult I shall not undertake
to decide. My concern is with its application to
the spiritual; and with such a reference, are there not
many in these hurrying days who would be benefited
by a serious attention to it?</p>

<p>Do you doubt its truth? Reflect, and you will be
convinced. Have you never groped darkly after a
principle, of which you had some dim revelation, and
which you strove with mightiest working to make your
own? Still as you seemed about to seize it, it eluded
your grasp; you were sure that it was there; but to
lay hold of it was beyond your strength. You gave up
the effort, turned your thoughts to a new channel,
and busied yourself with other investigations&mdash;when lo!
a revelation; and the truth you sought, burst upon
you as a ray from the eternal splendor.</p>

<p>Or, perchance, you have been all the day perplexed
and wearied with doubts, relating, it may be, to some
point of practical moment to you, and seeming to demand
a solution, which yet you are unable to give.
You would fain come to an end, but you cannot even
see an opening; only here and there an uncertain
glimmer, which vanishes when you approach it more
nearly. Your soul is faint and harassed; you go forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
at sunset to commune with nature, and in her communion
to forget your perplexities. You gaze on the calm
glories of the departing sun, and the calm enters into
your soul; the cooling breath of heaven comes to you,
and you listen to the many voices, "the melodies of
woods and winds and waters," that go up in one harmony
to heaven. You behold, and listen, and love;&mdash;and
with love comes light. Yes, a light, so pure, so
soft, so mild, that it seems not of earth rests upon your
soul, and your darkness, and doubts, and perplexity
are gone.</p>

<p>Oh, never let it be forgotten that the road to truth is
a winding road; it lies through the heart as well as
through the intellect; for, says the wise man, "Into a
malicious soul, wisdom shall not enter." Thou must
learn to love, before thou canst learn to know; and
never shalt thou behold the serene and beautiful countenance
of Truth, until thy aim be honest, and thy soul
in harmony with nature.</p>

<p>And are not <i>Nature's</i> paths circuitous? It is man
who has constructed the broad high road, and made
for himself a straight way through forests and streams,
levelling the mountains, and filling up the valleys&mdash;but
it is not thus in nature. Her paths are wild, and
devious, and rambling; following "the river's course,
the valley's playful windings," and ever and anon
turning aside to some sunny nook, or steep ravine. The
rain which falls upon the earth travels not by a plain
high road to the springs and fountains whither it is
bound; but gently, slowly wins its way, drop by drop,
till a little stream is formed, and the stream winds its
noiseless and hidden track to the fountain.</p>

<p>In her <i>processes</i> too, Nature is patient and long-waiting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
She doth not say to the seed just planted in the
earth, spring up and bear fruit forthwith, or you shall
be cast out, but she waiteth for the unfolding of the
tender germ, and the striking of the new-shooting roots;
and hath long patience, and with slowliest care, and a
mother's enduring love, she bringeth forth to light the
first green leaf. Then she calleth for the sun to shine,
and the dews to descend upon the young plant, and
many days doth she wait for the ripe fruit.</p>

<p>But man, impatient man would be wise in a day.
He waits not for the holy and mysterious processes of nature,
he leaves not the wonderful powers within him to
unfold in silence and secrecy, but must ever disturb
them with his foolish meddling and impertinent haste,
like some silly child, who digs up the seed he has planted
an hour ago, to see if it have yet sprouted. And
are there not some who deal in like fashion with other
minds than their own? <i>Educators</i> let them not be
called, for never do they bring out what is within. The
young mind is not to them a germ to be unfolded, an
infant to be nursed into manhood, but rather a receptacle
to be filled, and stuffed, and crammed as expeditiously
as possible; and this, thanks to the numerous
machines lately invented for the purpose, is very quick
indeed.</p>

<p>There have been times when you seemed to make
no progress in your favorite pursuit. You struggled
without advancing as we sometimes do in dreams, or
though you stepped up and down, it was as in a treadmill.
So it seemed to you. But was it so? Nay,
the process was going on within, though its visible
manifestations may have ceased. If no addition was
made to the superstructure, yet the foundations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
deepening and widening; if the branches and leaves
did not grow, yet the root strengthened itself in the
earth.</p>

<p>But not only so&mdash;you seemed to be going backward.
Even the ground slipped from under your feet, and
where you had heretofore a firm standing-place, you
found but a swamp. And have you never considered
that Nature too sometimes works backwards? See
that withered leaf which flutters in the breeze, maintaining
yet an uncertain hold upon the branch which
nurtured its younger growth. A fresh gust of wind
loosens its hold, and it is blown in circling eddies to the
earth. There it rests till the elements of decay in its
bosom have finished their work, and it mixes with the
dust. "What is this? Can a mother forget her child?
Does Nature destroy her own productions?" Ah, look
again. In that fresh-blooming flower, dyed with tints
of infinite softness, behold the withered leaf. Nature
was as really working to the production of that flower
when she decomposed the elements of the leaf, as
when she unfolded the germ, and elaborated the juices,
and blended the tints of the flower itself. It was but a
glorified resurrection. And your spiritual growth is
going on as truly and steadily, if not as visibly and
delightfully, when you cast aside the slough of some
old prejudice, or painfully tear yourself from a cherished
delusion as when the dawning of a new truth
flashes light and joy upon your soul.</p>

<p>For what Coleridge has said of nations, is equally
true of individuals. "The progress of the species
neither is nor can be, like that of a Roman road, in a
right line. It may be more justly compared to that of
a river, which, both in its smaller reaches and larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
turnings, is frequently forced back towards its fountains,
by objects which cannot otherwise be eluded or
overcome; yet with an accompanying impulse that
will ensure its advancement hereafter, it is either gaining
strength every hour or conquering in secret some
difficulty, by a labor that contributes as effectually to
further its course, as when it moves forward in an
uninterrupted line."</p>

<p>I might go on to illustrate the application of this
truth to self-knowledge, but it is one easily made, by
each for himself. Its bearing upon our moral growth
must not be so lightly passed over.</p>

<p>You have learned that you have a spirit which <i>may</i>
be, <i>must</i> be trained for immortality and heaven. You
have found too that there are difficulties in the way of
this training. There is a constant under-current of selfishness
ready to insinuate itself into all you do; there
is contempt for your inferiors in birth or cultivation,
ever offering to start up, and there is a spirit of resentment
against those who have injured you ready to take
fire on the least provocation. What is to be done with
these? You do not forget that to Him, whose "still,
small voice" can speak with authority to the spirits He
has made, must be your first appeal; but neither do
you forget that his help is vouchsafed to those only
who help themselves. And how will you help yourself?
Will you in the plenitude of your might, and the resoluteness
of kindled energy, <i>will</i> the extinction of those
unruly passions? Try it; exert the volition; <i>will</i> to
stop the flowing tide of revenge in your breast, and to
cause love and forgiveness to spring up in its place.
Well, have you done it? But what means that glowing
cheek&mdash;that flashing eye&mdash;that compressed brow? Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
such the expression of <i>love</i>? Nay brother, you have
mistaken the way. Not the straight path of direct
volition will ever lead you to your object.</p>

<p>But come forth with me into the field. Here are
"sweet, strange flowers," to glad thy heart with their
innocent beauty, and delight thee with their fragrance;
here is the broad and blessed "sky bending over" thee,
and the quiet lake at thy feet.</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The air is spread with beauty; and the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is musical with sounds that rise and die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till scarce the ear can catch them; then they swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then send from far a low, sweet, sad farewell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And who art thou that bringest discord and rough,
angry passions into a scene like this? Ah, thou bringest
not discord, it has stolen from thy heart; thou art
at peace. For it is not a poetic fiction when we are
told that a wayward spirit, is subdued by nature's
loveliness and <i>lovingness</i>.</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Till he can no more endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be a jarring and a dissonant thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst this general dance and minstrelsy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, bursting into tears, wins back his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His angry spirit healed and harmonized,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the benignant touch of love and beauty."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We asked, perchance, that our hearts might be lifted
above the earth, and taught to repose with a surer love,
and a more child-like trustfulness on the Father of
Spirits. And did we know that our prayer was answered
when the light of our eyes was torn from us;
when our souls were rent with bitter agony, and lay
crushed and bowed beneath the stroke of <i>His</i> hand?
Yes, it was answered; we know it now, though we
knew it not then. The weary bird never reposes so
sweetly in its nest, as when it hath been battered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the tempest and chased by the vulture; never doth the
little child rest so lovingly and rejoicingly on its mother's
breast, as when it hath there found a shelter from
the injuries and taunts of its rude play-fellows; and
the christian never knows the full sweetness of the
words, "My Father in Heaven," till he can also add,
"there is none that I desire beside Thee."</p>

<h2><a name="FRAGMENTS_OF_AN_ADDRESS_ON_MUSIC" id="FRAGMENTS_OF_AN_ADDRESS_ON_MUSIC"></a>FRAGMENTS OF AN ADDRESS ON MUSIC.</h2>

<h3>By Edward Payson.</h3>


<p>Without resorting to the hyperbolical expressions of
poetry, or to the dreams and fables of pagan mythology,
to the wonders said to be performed by the lyre of
Amphion and the harp of Orpheus,&mdash;I might place before
you the prophet of Jehovah, composing his ruffled
spirits by the soothing influence of music, that he might
be suitably prepared to receive a message from the
Lord of Hosts. I might present to your view the evil
spirit, by which jealous and melancholy Saul was afflicted,
flying, baffled and defeated, from the animating
and harmonious tones of David's harp. I might show
you the same David, the defender and avenger of his
flock, the champion and bulwark of his country, the
conqueror of Goliah, the greatest warrior and monarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of his age, laying down the sword and the sceptre to
take up his harp, and exchanging the titles of victor
and king for the more honorable title of the sweet
Psalmist of Israel.&mdash;But I appear not before you as her
advocate; for in that character my exertions would be
superfluous. She is present to speak for herself, and
assert her own claims to our notice and approbation.
You have heard her voice in the performances of this
evening; and those of you, whom the God of nature
has favored with a capacity of feeling and understanding
her eloquent language, will, I trust, acknowledge
that she has pleaded her own cause with triumphant
success; has given sensible demonstration, that she
can speak, not only to the ear, but to the heart; and
that she possesses irresistible power to soothe, delight,
and fascinate the soul. Nor was it to the senses alone
that she spake; but while, in harmonious sounds, she
maintained her claims, and asserted her powers; in a
still and small but convincing voice, she addressed herself
directly to reason and conscience, proclaiming the
most solemn and important truths; truths which perhaps
some of you did not hear or regard, but which
deserve and demand our most serious attention.&mdash;With
the same irresistible evidence as if an angel had spoken
from heaven, she said, There is a God&mdash;and that
God is good and benevolent. For, my friends, who
but God could have tuned the human voice, and given
harmony to sounds? Who, but a good and benevolent
God, would have given us senses capable of perceiving
and enjoying this harmony? Who, but such a
being, would have opened a way through the ear, for
its passage to the soul? Could blind chance have
produced these wonders of wisdom? or a malignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
being these miracles of goodness? Could they have
caused this admirable fitness between harmony of
sounds, and the organs of sense by which it is perceived?
No. They would have either given us no
senses, or left them imperfect, or rendered every sound
discordant and harsh. With the utmost propriety, therefore
may Jehovah ask, Who hath made man's mouth,
and planted the ear? Have not I, the Lord? With the
utmost justice, also, may he demand of us, that all our
musical powers and faculties should be consecrated to
his service, and employed in celebrating his praises.
To urge you diligently and cheerfully to perform this
pleasing, reasonable, and indispensable duty, is the
principal object of the speaker. Not, then, as the advocate
of music, but as the ambassador of that God,
whose being and benevolence, music proclaims, do I
now address this assembly, entreating every individual,
without delay, to adopt and practise the resolution of
the royal Psalmist&mdash;<i>I will sing unto the Lord as long
as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have
my being.</i> Psa. civ. 33.</p>

<p>In your imagination go back to the origin of the
world, when, every thing was very good, and all creation
harmonized together. All its parts, animate and
inanimate, like the voices and instruments of a well
regulated concert, helped to compose a perfect and
beautiful whole; and so exquisite was the harmony
thus produced, that in the whole compass of creation,
not one jarring or discordant note was heard, even by
the perfect ear of God himself.&mdash;The blessed angels
of light began the universal chorus, "when the morning
stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted
for joy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Of this universal concert, man was appointed the
terrestrial leader, and was furnished with natural and
moral powers, admirably fitted for this blessed and
glorious employment. His body, exempt from dissolution,
disease, and decay, was like a perfect and well-strung
instrument, which never gave forth a false or
uncertain sound, but always answered, with exact precision,
the wishes of his nobler part, the soul. His
heart did not then belie his tongue, when he sung the
praises of his Creator; but all the emotions felt by the
one were expressed by the other, from the high notes
of ecstatic admiration, thankfulness, and joy, down to
the deep tones of the most profound veneration and
humility. In a word, his heart was the throne of celestial
love and harmony, and his tongue at once the
organ of their will, and the sceptre of their power.</p>

<p>We are told, in ancient story, of a statue, formed
with such wonderful art, that, whenever it was visited
by the rays of the rising sun, it gave forth, in honor of
that luminary, the most melodious and ravishing sounds.
In like manner, man was originally so constituted, by
skill divine, that, whenever he contemplated the rays
of wisdom, power, and goodness, emanating from the
great Sun of the moral system, the ardent emotions of
his soul spontaneously burst forth in the most pure and
exalted strains of adoration and praise. Such was the
world, such was man, at the creation. Even in the
eye of the Creator, all was good; for, wherever he
turned, he saw only his own image, and heard nothing
but his own praises. Love beamed from every countenance;
harmony reigned in every breast, and flowed
mellifluous from every tongue; and the grand chorus
of praise, begun by raptured seraphs round the throne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and heard from heaven to earth, was reechoed back
from earth to heaven; and this blissful sound, loud as
the archangel's trump, and sweet as the melody of his
golden harp, rapidly spread, and was received from
world to world, and floated, in gently-undulating waves,
even to the farthest bounds of creation.</p>

<p>To this primeval harmony, a lamentable contrast
followed, when sin untuned the tongues of angels, and
changed their blissful songs of praise into the groans
of wretchedness, the execrations of malignity, the blasphemies
of impiety, and the ravings of despair. Storms
and tempests, earthquakes and convulsions, fire from
above, and deluges from beneath, which destroyed
the order of the natural world, proved that its baleful
influence had reached our earth, and afforded a faint
emblem of the jars and disorders which sin had introduced
into the moral system. Man's corporeal part,
that lyre of a thousand strings, tuned by the finger of
God himself, destined to last as long as the soul, and
to be her instrument in offering up eternal praise, was,
at one blow, shattered, unstrung, and almost irreparably
ruined. His soul, all whose powers and faculties,
like the chords of an Æolian harp, once harmoniously
vibrated to every breath of the divine Spirit, and ever
returned a sympathizing sound to the tones of kindness
and love from a fellow-being, now became silent,
and insensible to melody, or produced only the jarring
and discordant notes of envy, malice, hatred, and revenge.
The mouth, filled with cursing and bitterness,
was set against the heavens; the tongue was inflamed
with the fire of hell. Every voice, instead of uniting
in the song of "Glory to God in the highest," was
now at variance with the voices around it, and, in barbarous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and dissonant strains, sung praise to itself, or
was employed in muttering sullen murmurs against the
Most High&mdash;in venting slanders against fellow-creatures&mdash;in
celebrating and deifying some worthless idol,
or in singing the triumphs of intemperance, dissipation,
and excess. The noise of violence and cruelty was
heard mingled with the boasting of the oppressor, and
the cry of the oppressed, and the complaints of the
wretched; while the shouts of embattled hosts, the
crash of arms, the brazen clangor of trumpets, the
shrieks of the wounded, the groans of the dying, and
all the horrid din of war, together with the wailings of
those whom it had rendered widows and orphans, overwhelmed
and drowned every sound of benevolence,
praise and love. Such is the jargon which sin has introduced&mdash;such
the discord which, from every quarter
of our globe, has long ascended up into the ears of the
Lord of hosts.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BLUSH" id="THE_BLUSH"></a>THE BLUSH.</h2>

<h3>By Mrs. Elizabeth Smith.</h3>


<p>The soft warm air scarcely stirred the leaves of the
vine, that clustered about the bower of Eve, as she
lay with pale cheek and languid limbs, her first born
daughter resting upon her breast. Adam had led his
sons to the field, that their sports might not disturb the
repose of our first mother, and the low murmur of the
tiny cascade, the monotonous hum of insects, and
happy twitter of unfledged birds, all wooed her to slumber;
yet she slept not. She looked with a mother's
deep unutterable love upon the face of her babe, yet
tears were in her eye, and anxiety upon her brow.
Herself the last, the perfection of the Creator's workmanship,
she still marvelled at the surprising beauty of
her daughter. She looked into its dark liquid eye, and
drank deep from the fountain of maternal love. She
pressed its small foot and hand to her lips, hugged it
to her full heart, and felt again the bitterness of transgression.
She thought of Paradise, whence she had
expelled her children. She thought of generations to
come, who might curse her for their misery. She
thought of the sweet beauty of her child on whom she
had entailed sorrow, suffering and temptation. She
felt it murmuring at the fountain of life while it stretched
its little hand to her lips. She turned aside the
thick leaves of the grape vine, and looked out upon the
still blue sky, over which, scarcely moved the white
thin clouds. "My daughter," she faintly articulated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
"thou knowest not the evil I have done thee. Let
these bitter tears attest my penitence. Let me teach
thee so to live, that thou mayst hereafter obtain in
another world the Paradise thou hast lost in this&mdash;lost
by thy mother's guilt. O, my daughter, would that I
alone might suffer, that the whole wrath of my offended
Creator might fall on my head and thou, and such
as thou, might escape." The tears, the penitence of
Eve prevailed; a Heavenly messenger was despatched
to console her, to lift her thoughts to better hopes and
less gloomy anticipations.&mdash;Since the sin of our first
parents, and their banishment from Paradise, these
angel visits had been "few and far between," and our
first mother hailed his approach with awe and pleasure.
"Eve," kindly spake the divine visitant, "thy sorrow
and thy penitence are all known to thy Creator, and
though thy fault was great, he yet careth for thee. I
am sent to comfort thee. As thou didst disobey the
commands of God, death has been brought, indeed,
upon thy posterity, but thy children may not curse
thee. Thy daughters shall imitate thy penitence, and
so secure the favor of Heaven. To each one shall
be given a spirit, capable of resisting temptation, and
assimilating to that holiness from which thou hast departed.
Though sin and death have entered the world
by thy means, thy children will still have only their
own sins to answer for, and may not justly reproach
thee for their errors." "True, Lord," responded Eve,
"but the altered sky, the hard earth that scarcely yields
its treasures to the labor of Adam, and the changed
natures of the animals that once meekly and kindly
sported together, all tell of my disobedience, and my
daughter will turn her eyes upon me when suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and trial come, and that look will reproach me as the
cause. I am told that our children shall equal in number
the leaves of the green wood, and the earth shall
hereafter be peopled with beings like ourselves. I
shrink to think on the mass of sorrow I have brought
upon my daughters."</p>

<p>She looked fondly on her babe, and timidly raised
it towards the beneficent being who paused at her
bower. "When men shall become numerous, and
there shall be many beings like these, fair and frail,
may not their beauty&mdash;" She paused and looked
anxiously up. "Speak, Eve," said the messenger, "thy
request shall be granted. I am sent to bestow upon
thee whatever thou shalt ask, for this thy first born
daughter." "I scarcely know," resumed Eve, thus encouraged,
"but I would ask for this first daughter of an
erring mother, <i>something</i>, to warn her of even the
approach of sin, something, that will whisper caution,
and speak of innocence and purity. Something, Lord,
that will remind us of Paradise." "Hast thou not all
that, Eve, in the voice within, the voice of conscience?"
Eve dropped her head upon her bosom. "But that
monitor may be disregarded, my daughters may, like
their unhappy parent, stifle its voice and heedlessly
neglect its warnings. I would have something, that
when flattery would mislead, beauty bewilder, or passion
lead astray, would outwardly as it were bid them
take heed, warn them to shrink from the very trail of
the serpent whose insidious poison may corrupt and
destroy. Hast thou nothing that will be to the innocent,
the virtuous, like a second conscience, to cause them
to shrink even from the <i>appearance</i> of evil?" The
angel smiled, and answered our mother with kindness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and a look of heavenly satisfaction. "Most wisely
hast thou petitioned, O Eve. Thou hast asked blessings
for thy posterity, not for thyself. Thy daughters shall
bless thee for the gift thy prayer has obtained." The
spirit departed. The gift he bestowed may be seen on
the face of the maiden when she shrinks from the too
admiring gaze, when her ear is listening to the tale of
love, or flattery, when in the solitude of her own
thoughts she starts at her own imaginings, when she
shrinks even from her own reflected loveliness in the
secrecy of home; or abroad, trembles at the intrusive
touch, or familiar language, of him who <i>should be</i> her
guide, her protector from evil. That gift was the
<i>blush</i>.</p>

<span class="i0">And answered back that fearful knell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a long, sharp and hungry yell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A slow and solemn hour swept by,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And there, all still and motionless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rigid limb and stony eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The widow knelt in her distress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pitying looks the swarthy crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the tearless mourner drew,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">A slight convulsion stirr'd her face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to her heart she snatched the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And held him in a strong embrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then drawing o'er his brow her veil,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She turned her face as strangely wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a fiend had mocked her wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Parted her marble lips and smiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice she essayed to speak, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her face drooped o'er the corpse again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While forth from the disshevelled hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A husky whisper stirred the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Nay, bury him not here,' it said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I would have prayers above my dead;'<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From the infected barge withdrew:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Just in the margin of the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As resting from a feast of blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the corpse the widow flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her snowy arms, and madly clung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that cold bosom, whence a chill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot through her heart, and frantic still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes in horror turned to seek<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That prowling beast, whose hungry jaws<br /></span>

<h2><a name="JACK_DOWNINGS_VISIT_TO_PORTLAND" id="JACK_DOWNINGS_VISIT_TO_PORTLAND"></a>JACK DOWNING'S VISIT TO PORTLAND.</h2>

<h3>By Seba Smith.</h3>


<p>In the fall of the year 1829 I took it into my head I'd
go to Portland. I had heard a good deal about Portland,
what a fine place it was, and how the folks got
rich there proper fast; and that fall there was a couple
of new papers come up to Downingville from there,
called the Portland Courier and Family Reader; and
they told a good many queer kind of things about Portland
and one thing another; and all at once it popped
into my head, and I up and told father, and says I, I'm
going to Portland whether or no; and I'll see what
this world is made of yet. Father stared a little at
first, and said he was afraid I should get lost; but when
he see I was bent upon it, he give it up; and he stepped
to his chist and opened the till, and took out a dollar and
gave to me, and says he, Jack, this is all I can do for
you; but go, and lead an honest life, and I believe I shall
hear good of you yet. He turned and walked across
the room, but I could see the tears start into his eyes,
and mother sot down and had a hearty crying spell.
This made me feel rather bad for a minute or two,
and I almost had a mind to give it up; and then again
father's dream came into my mind, and I mustered up
courage, and declared I'd go. So I tackled up the old
horse and packed in a load of ax handles and a few
notions, and mother fried me some dough-nuts and put
'em into a box along with some cheese and sassages,
and ropped me up another shirt, for I told her I did n't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
know how long I should be gone; and after I got all
rigged out, I went round and bid all the neighbors good
bye, and jumped in and drove off for Portland.</p>

<p>Ant Sally had been married two or three years before
and moved to Portland, and I inquired round till I
found out where she lived, and went there and put the
old horse up and eat some supper and went to bed.
And the next morning I got up and straightened right
off to see the Editor of the Portland Courier, for I knew
by what I had seen in his paper that he was just the
man to tell me which way to steer. And when I come
to see him I knew I was right; for soon as I told him
my name and what I wanted, he took me by the hand
as kind as if he had been a brother; and says he, Mr.
Downing, I'll do any thing I can to assist you. You
have come to a good town; Portland is a healthy thriving
place, and any man with a proper degree of enterprise
may do well here. But says he, Mr. Downing,
and he looked mighty kind of knowing, says he, if you
want to make out to your mind, you must do as the
steamboats do. Well, says I, how do they do? for I
did n't know what a steam boat was, any more than
the man in the moon. Why, says he, they <i>go ahead</i>.
And you must drive about among the folks here jest
as though you were at home on the farm among the
cattle. Dont be afraid of any of 'em, but figure away,
and I dare say you will get into good business in a very
little while. But, says he, there's one thing you must
be careful of, and that is not to get into the hands of
them are folks that trades up round Huckler's Row:
for there's some sharpers up there, if they get hold of
you, would twist your eye teeth out in five minutes.
Well after he had gin me all the good advice he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
I went back to Ant Sally's again and got some breakfast,
and then I walked all over the town to see what
chance I could find to sell my ax handles and things,
and to get into business.</p>

<p>After I had walked about three or four hours I come
along towards the upper end of the town where I found
there were stores and shops of all sorts and sizes. And
I met a feller, and says I, what place is this? Why
this says he, is Huckler's Row. What, says I, are
these the stores where the traders in Huckler's Row
keep? And says he, yes. Well then, thinks I to myself,
I have a pesky good mind to go in and have a try
with one of these chaps, and see if they can twist my
eye teeth out. If they can get the best end of a bargain
out of me, they can do what there aint a man in
Downingville can do, and I should jest like to know
what sort of stuff these ere Portland chaps are made of.
So in I goes into the best looking store among 'em.
And I see some biscuit lying on the shelf, and says I,
Mister, how much do you ax apiece for them are biscuit?
A cent apiece, says he. Well, says I, I shant
give you that, but if you 've a mind to, I'll give you
two cents for three of 'em, for I begin to feel a little as
though I should like to take a bite. Well, says he, I
would n't sell 'em to any body else so, but seeing it 's
you I dont care if you take 'em. I knew he lied, for
he never see me before in his life. Well he handed
down the biscuits and I took 'em, and walked round the
store awhile to see what else he had to sell. At last,
says I, Mister, have you got any good new cider?
Says he, yes, as good as ever you see. Well, says I,
what do you ax a glass for it? Two cents, says he.
Well, says I, seems to me I feel more dry than I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
hungry now. Aint you a mind to take these ere biscuit
again and give me a glass of cider? And says he, I
dont care if I do; so he took and laid 'em on the shelf
again, and poured out a glass of cider. I took the
cider and drinkt it down, and to tell the truth it was
capital good cider. Then, says I, I guess it 's time for
me to be a going, and I stept along towards the door.
But, says he, stop Mister. I believe you have 'nt paid
me for the cider. Not paid you for the cider, says I,
what do you mean by that? Did n't the biscuit that I
give you jest come to the cider? Oh, ah, right, says
he. So I started to go again; and says he, but stop,
Mister, you did n't pay me for the biscuit. What, says
I, do you mean to impose upon me? do you think I am
going to pay you for the biscuit and let you keep 'em
tu? Aint they there now on your shelf, what more do
you want? I guess sir, you dont whittle me in that
way. So I turned about and marched off, and left the
feller staring and thinking and scratching his head, as
though he was struck with a dunderment. Howsomever,
I did n't want to cheat him, only jest to show 'em
it want so easy a matter to pull my eye teeth out, so I
called in next day and paid him his two cents. Well
I staid at Ant Sally's a week or two, and I went about
town every day to see what chance I could find to trade
off my ax handles, or hire out, or find some way or
other to begin to seek my fortune.</p>

<p>And I must confess the editor of the Courier was
about right in calling Portland a pretty good thriving
sort of a place; every body seemed to be as busy as
so many bees; and the masts of the vessels stuck up
round the wharves as thick as pine trees in uncle
Joshua's pasture; and the stores and the shops were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
thick, it seemed as if there was no end to 'em. In
short, although I have been round the world considerable,
from that time to this, all the way from Madawaska
to Washington, I 've never seen any place yet that
I think has any business to grin at Portland.</p>

<h2><a name="PORTLAND_AS_IT_WAS" id="PORTLAND_AS_IT_WAS"></a>PORTLAND AS IT WAS.</h2>

<h3>By William Willis.</h3>


<p>The advantages which in early days our new country
held out for employment, encouraged immigration, and
the population was almost wholly made up by accessions
from the more thickly peopled parts of Massachusetts.
To the county of Essex particularly, in the
early as well as more recent period of our history, the
town is indebted for large portions of its population.
Middlesex, Suffolk and the Old Colony, were not without
their contributions. But the people did not come
from such widely different sources as to produce any
difficulty of amalgamation, or any striking diversity of
manners. They formed one people and brought with
them the steady habits and good principles of those
from whom they had separated. There were some
accessions before the revolution made to our population
from the other side of the Atlantic; the emigrants
readily incorporated themselves with our people and
form a substantial part of the population. Within
twenty years, the numbers by immigration have increased
more rapidly, especially from Ireland, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
sufficiently to destroy the uniformity which characterises
our population, nor to disturb the harmony of our
community.</p>

<p>It cannot have escaped observation that one of the
principal sources of our wealth has been the lumber
trade. We have seen on the revival of the town in the
early part of the last century, how intimately the progress
of the town was connected with operations in
timber. Before the revolution our commerce was
sustained almost wholly by the large ships from England
which loaded here with masts, spars, and boards
for the mother country, and by ship building. The
West India business was then comparatively small,
employing but few vessels of inferior size. After the
revolution our trade had to form new channels, and the
employment of our own navigation was to give new
activity to all the springs of industry and wealth. We
find therefore that the enterprise of the people arose to
the emergency, and in a few years our ships were
floating on every ocean, becoming the carriers of
southern as well as northern produce, and bringing
back the money and commodities of other countries.
The trade to the West Indies, supported by our lumber,
increased vastly, and direct voyages were made in
larger vessels than had before been employed, which
received in exchange for the growth of our forests and
our seas, sugar, molasses and rum, the triple products
of the cane. This trade has contributed mainly to the
advancement and prosperity of the town, has nourished
a hardy race of seamen, and formed a people among
the most active and enterprising of any in the United
States.</p>

<p>The great changes which have taken place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
customs and manners of society since the revolution,
must deeply impress the mind of a reflecting observer.
These have extended not only to the outward forms of
things, but to the habits of thought and to the very
principles of character. The moral revolution has
been as signal and striking as the political one; it upturned
the old land marks of antiquated and hereditary
customs and the obedience to mere authority, and
established in their stead a more simple and just rule
of action; it set up reason and common sense, and a
true equality in the place of a factitious and conventional
state of society which unrelentingly required a
submission to its stern dictates; which made an unnatural
distinction in moral power, and elevated the rich
knave or fool to the station that humble and despised
merit would have better graced.</p>

<p>These peculiarities have been destroyed by the
silent and gradual operation of public opinion; the
spirit which arose in the new world is spreading with
the same effect over the old. Freedom of opinion is
asserting a just sway, and it is only now to be feared
that the principle will be carried too far, that authority
will lose all its influence and that reason and a just estimate
of human rights will not be sufficient restraints
upon the passions of men. The experiment is going
on, and unless education, an early and sound moral
education go on with it, which will enlighten and
strengthen the public mind, it will fail of success. The
feelings and passions must be placed under the charge
of moral principle, or we may expect an age of licentiousness
to succeed one of authority and rigid discipline.
We may be said now to be in the transition
state of society.</p>

<p>Distinctions of rank among different classes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
community, a part of the old system, prevailed very
much before the revolution and were preserved in the
dress as well as in the forms of society. But the deference
attached to robes of office and the formality of
official station have all fled before the genius of our
republican institutions; we look now upon the man and
not upon his garments nor upon the post to which
chance may have elevated him. In the circle of our
little town, the lines were drawn with much strictness.
The higher classes were called the <i>quality</i>, and were
composed of persons not engaged in mechanic employments.
We now occasionally find some old persons
whose memory recurs with longing delight to the days
in which these formal distinctions held uncontrolled
sway.</p>

<p>The fashionable color of clothes among this class
was drab; the coats were made with large cuffs reaching
to the elbows, and low collars. All classes wore
breeches which had not the advantage of being kept
up as in modern times by suspenders; the dandies of
that day wore embroidered silk vests with long pocket
flaps and ruffles over their hands. Most of those above
mentioned were engaged in trade, and the means of
none were sufficiently ample to enable them to live
without engaging in some employment. Still the pride
of their cast was maintained, and although the cloak
and perhaps the wig may have been laid aside in the
dust and hurry of business, they were scrupulously
retained when abroad.</p>

<p>There were many other expensive customs in that
day to which the spirit of the age required implicit
obedience; these demanded costly presents to be made
and large expenses to be incurred at the three most
important events in the history of man, his birth, marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and death. In the latter it became particularly
onerous and extended the influence of its example to
the poorest classes of people, who in their show of
grief, imitated, though at an immeasurable distance,
the customs of the rich.</p>

<p>The leaders of the people in the early part of the
revolution, with a view to check importations from
Britain, aimed a blow at these expensive customs, from
which they never recovered. The example commenced
in the highest places, of an entire abandonment of
all the outward trappings of grief which had been wont
to be displayed, and of all luxury in dress, which
extended over the whole community. In the later
stages of the revolution however, an extravagant and
luxurious style of living and dress was revived, encouraged
by the large amount both of specie and paper
money in circulation, and the great quantity of foreign
articles of luxury brought into the country by numerous
captures.</p>

<p>The evils here noticed did not exist in this part of
the country in any considerable degree, especially
after the revolution; the people were too poor to indulge
in an expensive style of living. They were literally
a working people, property had not descended
upon them from a rich ancestry, but whatever they
had accumulated had been the result of their own industry
and economy. Our ladies too at that period
had not forgotten the use of the distaff, and occasionally
employed that antiquated instrument of domestic
labor for the benefit of others as well as of themselves.
The following notice of a <i>spinning bee</i> at Mrs. Deane's
on the first of May 1788, is a flattering memorial of
the industry and skill of the females of our town at
that period.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the first instant, assembled at the house of the
Rev. Samuel Deane of this town, more than one hundred
of the fair sex, married and single ladies, most of
whom were skilled in the important art of spinning.
An emulous industry was never more apparent than
in this beautiful assembly. The majority of fair hands
gave motion to not less than sixty wheels. Many were
occupied in preparing the materials, besides those who
attended to the entertainment of the rest, provision for
which was mostly presented by the guests themselves,
or sent in by other generous promoters of the exhibition,
as were also the materials for the work. Near
the close of the day, Mrs. Deane was presented by the
company with <i>two hundred and thirty-six</i> seven knotted
skeins of excellent cotton and linen yarn, the work
of the day, excepting about a dozen skeins which
some of the company brought in ready spun. Some
had spun six, and many not less than five skeins apiece.
To conclude and crown the day, a numerous band of
the best singers attended in the evening, and performed
an agreeable variety of excellent pieces in psalmody."</p>

<p>Some of the ante-revolutionary customs "more honored
in the breach than in the observance"&mdash;have
been continued quite to our day, although not precisely
in the same manner, nor in equal degree. One was
the practise of helping forward every undertaking by a
deluge of ardent spirit in some of its multifarious mistifications.
Nothing could be done from the burial of
a friend or the quiet sessions of a town committee; to
the raising of the frame of a barn or a meeting-house,
but the men must be goaded on by the stimulus of rum.
Flip and punch were then the indispensable accompaniments
of every social meeting and of every enterprise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not a great while since similar customs have
extensively prevailed not perhaps in precisely the instances
or degree above mentioned, but in junkettings,
and other meetings which have substituted whiskey
punch, toddy, &amp;c. for the soothing but pernicious compounds
of our fathers. Thanks however to the genius
of temperance, a redeeming spirit is abroad, which it is
hoped will save the country from the destruction that
seemed to threaten it from this source.</p>

<p>The amusements of our people in early days had
nothing particular to distinguish them. The winter
was generally a merry season, and the snow was always
improved for sleighing parties out of town. In
summer the badness of the roads prevented all riding
for pleasure; in that season the inhabitants indulged
themselves in water parties, fishing and visiting the
islands, a recreation that has lost none of its relish at
this day.</p>

<p>Dancing does not seem to have met with much
favor, for we find upon record in 1766, that Theophilus
Bradbury and wife, Nathaniel Deering and wife, John
Waite and wife, and several other of the most respectable
people in town were indicted for dancing at Joshua
Freeman's tavern in December 1765. Mr. Bradbury
brought himself and friends off by pleading that
the room in which the dance took place, having been
hired by private individuals for the season, was no
longer to be considered as a public place of resort, but
a private apartment, and that the persons there assembled
had a right to meet in their own room and to
dance there. The court sustained the plea. David
Wyer was king's attorney at this time.</p>

<p>It was common for clubs and social parties to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
at the tavern in those days, and Mrs. Greele's in Backstreet
was a place of most fashionable resort both for
old and young wags, before as well as after the revolution.
It was the <i>Eastcheap</i> of Portland, and was as
famous for <i>baked beans</i> as the "Boar's head" was for
sack, although we would by no means compare honest
Dame Greele, with the more celebrated, though less
deserving hostess of Falstaff and Poins. Many persons
are now living on whose heads the frosts of age have
extinguished the fires of youth, who love to recur to
the amusing scenes and incidents associated with that
house.</p>

<p>When we look back a space of just two hundred
years and compare our present situation, surrounded
by all the beauty of civilization and intelligence, with
the cheerless prospect which awaited the European
settler, whose voice first startled the stillness of the
forest; or if we look back but one hundred years to
the humble beginnings of the second race of settlers,
who undertook the task of reviving the waste places of
this wilderness, and suffered all the privations and hardships
which the pioneers in the march of civilization
are called upon to endure; or if we take a nearer point
for comparison, and view the blackened ruin of our
village at the close of the revolutionary war, and estimate
the proud pre-eminence over all those periods
which we now enjoy, in our civil relations and in the
means of social happiness, our hearts should swell with
gratitude to the Author of all good that these high
privileges are granted to us; and we should resolve
that we will individually and as a community sustain
the purity and moral tone of our institutions, and leave
them unimpaired to posterity.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHEROKEES_THREAT" id="THE_CHEROKEES_THREAT"></a>THE CHEROKEE'S THREAT.</h2>

<h3>By N. P. Willis.</h3>


<p>At the extremity of a green lane in the outer skirt of
the fashionable suburb of New-Haven, stood a rambling
old Dutch house, built, probably, when the cattle
of Mynheer grazed over the present site of the town.
It was a wilderness of irregular rooms, of no describable
shape in its exterior, and from its southern balcony,
to use an expressive gallicism, <i>gave</i> upon the bay.
Long Island Sound, the great highway from the northern
Atlantic to New York, weltered in alternate lead
and silver (oftener like the brighter metal, for the climate
is divine) between the curving lip of the bay,
and the interminable and sandy shore of the island
some six leagues distant, the procession of ships and
steamers stole past with an imperceptible progress, the
ceaseless bells of the college chapel came deadened
through the trees from behind, and (the day being one
of golden Autumn, and myself and St. John waiting
while black Agatha answered the door-bell) the sun-steeped
precipice of East Rock with its tiara of blood-red
maples flushing like a Turk's banner in the light,
drew from us both a truant wish for a ramble and a
holiday.</p>

<p>In a few minutes from this time were assembled in
Mrs. Ilfrington's drawing-room the six or seven young
ladies of my more particular acquaintance among her
pupils&mdash;of whom one was a new-comer, and the object
of my mingled curiosity and admiration. It was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
one day of the week when morning visiters were admitted,
and I was there in compliance with an unexpected
request from my friend, to present him to the
agreeable circle of Mrs. Ilfrington. As an <i>habitue</i> in
her family, this excellent lady had taken occasion to
introduce to me a week or two before, the new-comer
of whom I have spoken above&mdash;a departure from the
ordinary rule of the establishment, which I felt to be a
compliment, and which gave me, I presumed, a tacit
claim to mix myself up in that young lady's destiny as
deeply as I should find agreeable. The new-comer
was the daughter of an Indian chief, and her name
was Nunu.</p>

<p>The transmission of the daughter of a Cherokee
chief to New-Haven, to be educated at the expense of
the government, and of several young men of the same
high birth to different colleges, will be recorded among
the evidences in history that we did not plough the
bones of their fathers into our fields without some feelings
of compunction. Nunu had come to the seaboard
under the charge of a female missionary, whose pupil
she had been in one of the native schools of the west,
and was destined, though a chief's daughter, to return
as a teacher to her tribe, when she should have mastered
some of the higher accomplishments of her sex.
She was an apt scholar, but her settled melancholy
when away from her books, had determined Mrs. Ilfrington
to try the effect of a little society upon her,
and hence my privilege to ask for her appearance in
the drawing-room.</p>

<p>As we strolled down in the alternate shade and sunshine
of the road, I had been a little piqued at the
want of interest and the manner of course with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
St. John had received my animated descriptions of the
personal beauty of the Cherokee.</p>

<p>"I have hunted with the tribe," was his only answer,
"and know their features."</p>

<p>"But she is not like them," I replied with a tone of
some impatience; "she is the <i>beau-ideal</i> of a red skin,
but it is with the softened features of an Arab or an
Egyptian. She is more willowy than erect, and has
no higher cheek-bones than the plaster Venus in your
chambers. If it were not for the lambent fire in her
eye, you might take her in the sculptured grace of her
attitudes, for an immortal bronze of Cleopatra. I tell
you she is divine!"</p>

<p>St. John called to his dog and we turned along the
green bank above the beach, with Mrs. Ilfrington's
house in view, and so opens a new chapter of my story.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I have seen in many years wandering over the world,
lived to gaze upon, and live to remember and adore&mdash;a
constellation, I almost believe, that has absorbed all
the intensest light of the beauty of a hemisphere&mdash;yet
with your pictures coloured to life in my memory, and
the pride of rank and state thrown over them like an
elevating charm&mdash;I go back to the school of Mrs. Ilfrington,
and (smile if you will!) they were as lovely
and stately, and as worthy of the worship of the world.</p>

<p>I introduced St. John to the young ladies as they
came in. Having never seen him except in the presence
of men, I was a little curious to know whether
his singular <i>aplomb</i> would serve him as well with the
other sex, of which I was aware he had had a very
slender experience. My attention was distracted at
the moment of mentioning his name to a lovely little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Georgian, (with eyes full of the liquid sunshine of the
south,) by a sudden bark of joy from the dog who had
been left in the hall; and as the door opened, and the
slight and graceful Indian girl entered the room, the
usually unsocial animal sprung bounding in, lavishing
caresses on her, and seemingly wild with the delight
of recognition.</p>

<p>In the confusion of taking the dog from the room, I
had again lost the moment of remarking St. John's
manner, and on the entrance of Mrs. Ilfrington, Nunu
was sitting calmly by the piano, and my friend was
talking in a quiet undertone with the passionate Georgian.</p>

<p>"I must apologise for my dog," said St. John, bowing
gracefully to the mistress of the house; "he was
bred by Indians, and the sight of a Cherokee reminded
him of happier days&mdash;as it did his master."</p>

<p>Nunu turned her eyes quickly upon him, but immediately
resumed her apparently deep study of the abstruse
figures in the Kidderminster carpet.</p>

<p>"You are well arrived, young gentlemen," said
Mrs. Ilfrington; "we press you into our service for a
botanical ramble, Mr. Slingsby is at leisure, and will be
delighted I am sure. Shall I say as much for you,
Mr. St. John?" St. John bowed, and the ladies left
the room for their bonnets, Mrs. Ilfrington last.</p>

<p>The door was scarcely closed when Nunu re-appeared,
and checking herself with a sudden feeling at the
first step over the threshold, stood gazing at St. John,
evidently under very powerful emotion.</p>

<p>"Nunu!" he said, smiling slowly and unwillingly,
and holding out his hands with the air of one who forgives
an offence.</p>

<p>She sprang upon his bosom with the bound of a leveret,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and, between her fast kisses broke the endearing
epithets of her native tongue&mdash;in words that I only understood
by their passionate and thrilling accent. The
language of the heart is universal.</p>

<p>The fair scholars came in one after another, and we
were soon on our way through the green fields to the
flowery mountain side of East Rock, Mrs. Ilfrington's
arm and conversation having fallen to my share, and
St. John rambling at large with the rest of the party,
but more particularly beset by Miss Temple, whose
Christian name was Isabella, and whose Christian charity
had no bowels for broken hearts.</p>

<p>The most sociable individuals of the party for a
while were Nunu and Last, the dog's recollections of
the past seeming, like those of wiser animals, more
agreeable than the present. The Cherokee astonished
Mrs. Ilfrington by an abandonment of joy and frolic
which she had never displayed before, sometimes fairly
outrunning the dog at full speed, and sometimes sitting
down breathless upon a green bank, while the
rude creature overpowered her with his caresses. The
scene gave rise to a grave discussion between that well-instructed
lady and myself upon the singular force of
childish association&mdash;the extraordinary intimacy between
the Indian and the trapper's dog being explained
satisfactorily, to her at least, on that attractive principle.
Had she but seen Nunu spring into the bosom of
my friend half an hour before, she might have added a
material corollary to her proposition. If the dog and
the chief's daughter were not old friends, the chief's
daughter and St. John certainly <i>were</i>!</p>

<p>As well as I could judge by the motions of two people
walking before me, St. John was advancing fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
in the favor and acquaintance of the graceful Georgian.
Her southern indolence was probably an apology in
Mrs. Ilfrington's eyes for leaning heavily on her companion's
arm, but, in a momentary halt, the capricious
beauty disembarrassed herself of the light scarf that
had floated over her shoulders, and bound it playfully
around his waist. This was rather strange on a first
acquaintance, and Mrs. Ilfrington was of that opinion.</p>

<p>"Miss Temple!" said she, advancing to whisper a
reproof in the beauty's ear.</p>

<p>Before she had taken a second step, Nunu bounded
over the low hedge, followed by the dog with whom
she had been chasing a butterfly, and springing upon
St. John, with eyes that flashed fire, she tore the scarf
into shreds, and stood trembling and pale, with her feet
on the silken fragments.</p>

<p>"Madam!" said St. John, advancing to Mrs. Ilfrington,
after casting on the Cherokee a look of surprise
and displeasure, "I should have told you before, that
your pupil and myself are not new acquaintances.
Her father is my friend. I have hunted with the tribe,
and have hitherto looked upon Nunu as a child. You
will believe me, I trust, when I say, her conduct surprises
me, and I beg to assure you, that any influence
I may have over her, will be in accordance with your
own wishes exclusively."</p>

<p>His tone was cold, and Nunu listened with fixed lips
and frowning eyes.</p>

<p>"Have you seen her before since her arrival?"
asked Mrs. Ilfrington.</p>

<p>"My dog brought me yesterday the first intelligence
that she was here. He returned from his morning
ramble with a string of wampum about his neck, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
had the mark of the tribe. He was her gift," he added,
patting the head of the dog and looking with a
softened expression at Nunu, who drooped her head
upon her bosom and walked on in tears.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The chain of the Green Mountains, after a gallop of
some five hundred miles from Canada to Connecticut,
suddenly pulls up on the shore of Long Island Sound,
and stands rearing with a bristling mane of pine-trees,
three hundred feet in air, as if checked in midcareer
by the sea. Standing on the brink of this bold precipice,
you have the bald face of the rock in a sheer
perpendicular below you; and, spreading away from
the broken masses at its foot, lies an emerald meadow
inlaid with a crystal and rambling river, across which,
at a distance of a mile or two, rise the spires of the
university from what else were a thick serried wilderness
of elms. Back from the edge of the precipice
extends a wild forest of hemlock and fir, ploughed on
its northern side by a mountain torrent, whose bed of
marl, dry and overhung with trees in the summer,
serves as a path and guide from the plain to the summit.
It were a toilsome ascent but for that smooth
and hard pavement, and the impervious and green
thatch of pine-tassels overhung.</p>

<p>The kind mistress ascended with the assistance of
my arm, and St. John drew stoutly between Miss
Temple and a fat young lady with an incipient asthma.
Nunu had not been seen since the first cluster of hanging
flowers had hidden her from our sight as she bounded
upward.</p>

<p>The hour or two of slanting sunshine, poured in upon
the summit of the precipice from the west, had been
sufficient to induce a fine and silken moss to show its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
fibres and small blossoms above the carpet of pine-tassels,
and, emerging from the brown shadow of the
wood, you stood on a verdant platform, the foliage of
sighing trees overhead, a fairies' velvet beneath you,
and a view below, that you may as well (if you would
not die in your ignorance) make a voyage to see.</p>

<p>We found Nunu lying thoughtfully near the brink
of the precipice and gazing off over the waters of the
sound, as if she watched the coming or going of a
friend under the white sails that glanced upon its bosom.
We recovered our breath in silence, I alone
perhaps of that considerable company gazing with admiration
at the lithe and unconscious figure of grace
lying in the attitude of the Grecian hermaphrodite on
the brow of the rock before us. Her eyes were moist,
and motionless with abstraction, her lips just perceptibly
curved in an expression of mingled pride and sorrow,
her small hand buried and clenched in the moss, and
her left foot and ankle, models of spirited symmetry,
escaped carelessly from her dress, the high instep
strained back, as if recovering from a leap with the
tense control of emotion.</p>

<p>The game of the coquettish Georgian was well played.
With a true woman's pique, she had redoubled
her attentions to my friend from the moment that she
found it gave pain to another of her sex; and St. John,
like most men, seemed not unwilling to see a new altar
kindled to his vanity, though a heart he had already
won, was stifling with the incense. Miss Temple was
very lovely: her skin of that teint of opaque and patrician
white, which is found oftenest in Asian latitudes,
was just perceptibly warmed toward the centre of the
cheek with a glow like sunshine through the thick white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
petal of a magnolia: her eyes were hazel with those
inky lashes which enhance the expression a thousand
fold either of passion, or melancholy; her teeth were
like strips from the lily's heart; and she was clever,
captivating, graceful, and a thorough coquette. St.
John was mysterious, romantic-looking, superior, and
just now the only victim in the way. He admired, as
all men do, those qualities, which to her own sex, rendered
the fair Isabella unamiable, and yielded himself,
as all men will, a satisfied prey to enchantments of
which he knew the springs were the pique and vanity
of the enchantress. How singular it is that the highest
and best qualities of the female heart are those with
which men are the least captivated!</p>

<p>A rib of the mountain formed a natural seat a little
back from the pitch of the precipice, and here sat Miss
Temple, triumphant in drawing all eyes upon herself
and her tamed lion, her lap full of flowers which he
had found time to gather on the way, and her fair
hands employed in arranging a bouquet, of which the
destiny was yet a secret. Next to their own loves,
ladies like nothing on earth like mending or marring
the loves of others; and, while the violets and already
drooping wild flowers were coquettishly chosen or rejected
by those slender fingers, the sun might have
swung back to the east like a pendulum, and those
seven-and-twenty misses would have watched their
lovely schoolfellow the same. Nunu turned her head
slowly around at last, and silently looked on. St. John
lay at the feet of the Georgian, glancing from the flowers
to her face, and from her face to the flowers, with
an admiration not at all equivocal. Mrs. Ilfrington sat
apart, absorbed in finishing a sketch of New-Haven;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and I, interested painfully in watching the emotions of
the Cherokee, sat with my back to the trunk of a hemlock,
the only spectator who comprehended the whole
extent of the drama.</p>

<p>A wild rose was set in the heart of the bouquet at
last, a spear of riband-grass added to give it grace and
point, and nothing was wanting but a string.</p>

<p>Reticules were searched, pockets turned inside out,
and never a bit of riband to be found. The beauty
was in despair.</p>

<p>"Stay!" said St. John, springing to his feet. "Last!
Last!"</p>

<p>The dog came coursing in from the wood, and
crouched to his master's hand.</p>

<p>"Will a string of wampum do?" he asked, feeling
under the long hair on the dog's neck, and untying a
fine and variegated thread of many-colored beads,
worked exquisitely.</p>

<p>The dog growled, and Nunu sprang into the middle
of the circle with the fling of an adder, and seizing the
wampum as he handed it to her rival, called the dog
and fastened it once more around his neck.</p>

<p>The ladies rose in alarm; the belle turned pale and
clung to St. John's arm; the dog, with his hair bristling
on his back, stood close to her feet in an attitude of defiance,
and the superb Indian, the peculiar genius of
her beauty developed by her indignation, her nostrils
expanded and her eyes almost showering fire in their
flashes, stood before them, like a young Pythoness,
ready to strike them dead with a regard.</p>

<p>St. John recovered from his astonishment after a
moment, and leaving the arm of Miss Temple, advanced
a step and called to his dog.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The Cherokee patted the animal on the back, and
spoke to him in her own language; and, as St. John
still advanced, Nunu drew herself to her fullest height,
placed herself before the dog, who slunk growling from
his master, and said to him as she folded her arms,
"the wampum is mine!"</p>

<p>St. John colored to the temples with shame.</p>

<p>"Last!" he cried, stamping with his foot, and endeavoring
to frighten him from his shelter.</p>

<p>The dog howled and crept away, half crouching
with fear toward the precipice; and St. John shooting
suddenly past Nunu, seized him on the brink, and held
him down by the throat.</p>

<p>The next instant a scream of horror from Mrs. Ilfrington,
followed by a terrific echo from every female
present, started the rude Kentuckian to his feet.</p>

<p>Clear over the abyss, hanging with one hand by an
aspen sapling, the point of her tiny foot just poising on
a projecting ledge of rock, swung the desperate Cherokee,
sustaining herself with perfect ease, but with all
the determination of her iron race collected in calm
concentration on her lips.</p>

<p>"Restore the wampum to his neck!" she cried,
with a voice that thrilled the very marrow with its subdued
fierceness, "or my blood rest on your soul!"</p>

<p>St. John flung it toward the dog, and clasped his
hands in silent horror.</p>

<p>The Cherokee bore down the sapling till its slender
stem cracked with the tension, and rising lightly with
the rebound, alit like a feather upon the rock. The
subdued Kentuckian sprang to her side; but, with scorn
on her lip and the flush of exertion already vanished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
from her cheek, she called to the dog, and with rapid
strides took her way alone down the mountain.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Five years had elapsed. I had put to sea from the
sheltered river of boyhood; had encountered the storms
of a first entrance into life; had trimmed my boat,
shortened sail, and with a sharp eye to windward, was
laying fairly on my course. Among others from whom
I had parted company, was Paul St. John, who had
shaken hands with me at the university-gate, leaving
me, after four years' intimacy, as much in doubt as to
his real character and history as the first day we met.
I had never heard him speak of either father or mother;
nor had he, to my knowledge, received a letter
from the day of his matriculation. He passed his vacation
at the university. He had studied well, yet
refused one of the highest college-honors offered him
with his degree. He had shown many good qualities,
yet some unaccountable faults; and, all in all, was an
enigma to myself and the class. I knew him clever,
accomplished, and conscious of superiority, and my
knowledge went no farther.</p>

<p>It was five years from this time, I say, and in the
bitter struggles of first manhood, I had almost forgotten
there was such a being in the world. Late in the
month of October, in 1829, I was on my way westward,
giving myself a vacation from the law. I embarked on
a clear and delicious day in the small steamer which
plies up and down the Cayuga Lake, looking forward
to a calm feast of scenery, and caring little who were
to be my fellow passengers. As we got out of the little
harbor of Cayuga, I walked astern for the first time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and saw the not very unusual sight of a group of Indians
standing motionless by the wheel. They were
chiefs returning from a diplomatic visit to Washington.</p>

<p>I sat down by the companion-ladder, and opened
soul and eye to the glorious scenery we were gliding
through. The first severe frost had come, and the
miraculous change had passed upon the leaves, which
is known only in America. The blood-red sugar-maple,
with a leaf brighter and more delicate than a
Circassian's lip, stood here and there in the forest like
the sultan's standard in a host, the solitary and far-seen
aristocrat of the wilderness; the birch, with its
spirit-like and amber leaves, ghosts of the departed
summer, turned out along the edges of the woods like
a lining of the palest gold; the broad sycamore and
the fan-like catalpa, flaunted their saffron foliage in the
sun, spotted with gold like the wings of a lady-bird;
the kingly oak, with its summit shaken bare, still hid
its majestic trunk in a drapery of sumptuous dies like
a stricken monarch, gathering his robes of state about
him to die royally in his purple; the tall poplar, with
its minaret of silver leaves, stood blanched like a coward
in the dying forest, burdening every breeze with
its complainings; the hickory, paled through its enduring
green; the bright berries of the mountain-ash
flushed with a sanguine glory in the unobstructed sun;
the gaudy tulip-tree, the sybarite of vegetation, stripped
of its golden cups, still drank the intoxicating light of
noonday in leaves than which the lip of Indian shell
was never more delicately teinted; the still deeper-died
vines of the lavish wilderness, perishing with the nobler
things whose summer they had shared, outshone them
in their decline, as woman in her death is heavenlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
than the being on whom in life she leaned; and alone
and unsympathizing in this universal decay, outlaws
from nature, stood the fir and the hemlock, their frowning
and sombre heads, darker and less lovely than ever
in contrast with the death-struck glory of their companions.</p>

<p>The dull colors of English autumnal foliage, give
you no conception of this marvellous phenomenon.
The change here, too, is gradual. In America it is
the work of a night&mdash;of a single frost! Ah, to have
seen the sun set on hills, bright in the still green and
lingering summer, and to wake in the morning to a
spectacle like this! It is as if a myriad of rainbows
were laced through the tree-tops&mdash;as if the sunsets of
a summer&mdash;gold, purple and crimson&mdash;had been fused
in the alembic of the west, and poured back in a new
deluge of light and color over the wilderness. It is as
if every leaf in those countless trees had been painted
to outflush the tulip&mdash;as if, by some electric miracle,
the dies of the earth's heart had struck upward, and
her crystals and ore, her sapphires, hyacinths and rubies,
had let forth their imprisoned dies to mount
through the roots of the forest, and like the angels that
in olden time entered the bodies of the dying, reanimate
the perishing leaves, and revel an hour in their bravery.</p>

<p>I was sitting by the companion-ladder, thinking to
what on earth these masses of foliage could be resembled,
when a dog sprang upon my knees, and, the
moment after, a hand was laid on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"St. John? Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Bodily!" answered my quondam classmate.</p>

<p>I looked at him with astonishment. The <i>soigne</i> man
of fashion I had once known, was enveloped in a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of hunter's frock, loose and large, and girded to his
waist by a belt; his hat was exchanged for a cap of
rich otter-skin; his pantaloons spread with a slovenly
carelessness over his feet, and altogether there was
that in his air which told me at a glance that he had
renounced the world. Last had recovered his leanness,
and after wagging out his joy, he couched between my
feet, and lay looking into my face as if he was brooding
over the more idle days in which we had been acquainted.</p>

<p>"And where are <i>you</i> bound?" I asked, having answered
the same question for myself.</p>

<p>"Westward with the chiefs!"</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"The remainder of my life."</p>

<p>I could not forbear an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>"You would wonder less," said he, with an impatient
gesture, "if you knew more of me. And by the
way," he added, with a smile, "I think I never told
you the first half of the story&mdash;my life up to the time
I met you."</p>

<p>"It was not for the want of a catechist," I answered,
setting myself in an attitude of attention.</p>

<p>"No! and I was often tempted to gratify your curiosity;
but from the little intercourse I had with the
world I had adopted some precocious principles, and
one was, that a man's influence over others was vulgarism,
and diminished by a knowledge of his history."</p>

<p>I smiled, and as the boat sped on her way over the
calm waters of the Cayuga, St. John went on leisurely
with a story which is scarce remarkable enough to
merit a repetition. He believed himself the natural
son of a western hunter, but only knew that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
passed his early youth on the borders of civilization,
between whites and Indians, and that he had been more
particularly indebted for protection to the father of
Nunu. Mingled ambition and curiosity had led him
eastward while still a lad, and a year or two of the
most vagabond life in the different cities, had taught
him the caution and bitterness for which he was so remarkable.
A fortunate experiment in lotteries supplied
him with the means of education, and with singular
application in a youth of such wandering habits, he had
applied himself to study under a private master, fitted
himself for the university in half the usual time, and
cultivated in addition the literary taste which I have
remarked upon.</p>

<p>"This," he said, smiling at my look of astonishment,
"brings me up to the time when we met. I came to
college at the age of eighteen, with a few hundred
dollars in my pocket, some pregnant experience of the
rough side of the world, great confidence in myself and
distrust of others, and, I believe, a kind of instinct of
good manners, which made me ambitious of shining in
society. You were a witness of my <i>debut</i>. Miss
Temple was the first highly educated woman I had
ever known, and you saw the effect on me!"</p>

<p>"And since we parted?"</p>

<p>"Oh, since we parted, my life has been vulgar
enough. I have ransacked civilized life to the bottom,
and found it a heap of unredeemed falsehoods. I do
not say it from common disappointment, for I may say
I succeeded in every thing I undertook."</p>

<p>"Except Miss Temple," I said, interrupting, at the
hazard of wounding him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. She was a coquette, and I pursued her till
I had my turn. You see me in my new character now.
But a month ago, I was the Apollo of Saratoga, playing
my own game with Miss Temple. I left her for a
woman worth ten thousand of her&mdash;but here she is."</p>

<p>As Nunu came up the companionway from the cabin,
I thought I had never seen a breathing creature so exquisitely
lovely. With the exception of a pair of brilliant
moccasins on her feet, she was dressed in the usual
manner, but with the most absolute simplicity. She
had changed in those five years from the child to the
woman, and, with a round and well-developed figure,
additional height, and manners at once gracious and
dignified, she walked and looked the chieftan's daughter.
St. John took her hand, and gazed on her with
moisture in his eyes.</p>

<p>"That I could ever put a creature like this," he
said, "into comparison with the dolls of civilization!"</p>

<p>We parted at Buffalo&mdash;St. John with his wife and
the chiefs to pursue their way westward by Lake Erie,
and I to go moralizing on my way to Niagara.</p>

<h2><a name="GRECIAN_AND_ROMAN_ELOQUENCE" id="GRECIAN_AND_ROMAN_ELOQUENCE"></a>GRECIAN AND ROMAN ELOQUENCE.</h2>

<h3>By Ashur Ware.</h3>


<p>In the flourishing periods of the Grecian and Roman
commonwealths, the forms of their governments, the
state of society, and the passions and manners of the
times, were more favorable to the developement of
great talents, than have existed in any other age, or
among any other people. In Athens and Rome, every
citizen was a public man. The great powers of government
were exercised by the people themselves in
their primary assemblies. The practice of delegating
the higher attributes of sovereignty to a small number
of persons periodically elected is one of the greatest
improvements, which the lights of modern experience
have introduced into the constitutions of free governments.
The advantages which are gained by this system
in favor of internal tranquillity, the steadiness and
permanency of political institutions and the security of
private rights, can scarcely be estimated too highly, or
purchased at too great a price. But nearly in the
same proportion as this improvement contributes to the
general tranquillity and the personal security of the
citizen, does it narrow the field for the operation of
great talents. The individual power of each man is
hardly felt in the harmonious working of the great
machine of government, and its character soon comes
to depend much more on the system than on the genius
of those by whom it is conducted. Precedents,
fixed opinions, long established policy and constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
maxims, throw an invisible net work over those, who
are at the head of affairs, which a giant's strength
cannot break through. An ordinary share of talent,
enlightened by experience, is found to be about as
useful in the regular movement of the system, as the
highest gifts of genius.</p>

<p>But it was otherwise in the republics of Athens and
Rome. There the power of the system was nothing,
and the genius of the individual every thing. In the
agitations of these popular commonwealths, the great
actors on the stage were driven to a life of unremitted
exertion. The revolutions of popular favor were sudden
and appalling, and always liable to be carried to
great extremes. A decisive moment lost might be
fatal to the hopes of a whole life. Their powers were,
therefore, constantly wound up to the utmost intensity
of action. Second rate men, who are abundantly able
to go through with the regular and quiet routine of
official duty in our modern bureaus, would be quickly
blown down by the storms which shook the tribunes of
those turbulent democracies. The very imperfections
in their political systems contributed to develope the
genius of their statesmen, and necessarily called into
action every faculty of the mind.</p>

<p>In all free and popular governments, eloquence is
one of the principal instruments of power, and the
fairest field is presented for its operations where the
general powers of government are put in motion by
the immediate agency of the mass of the people. In
all the nations of modern Europe, where the semblance
of deliberative assemblies is preserved, these are composed
of a small and select number of persons; and
in these small bodies, when a reasonable space is allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
for the coercive power of party training, for the
operation of the subtle and diffusive poison of executive
influence, and in some cases, for the gross and
palpable application of direct corruption, the province
of eloquence will be found to be greatly narrowed.
Her most persuasive accents fall on ears that are spellbound
by a mightier power, and on the most important
questions, the votes are often counted, before deliberation
commences. But this complicated machinery
cannot be brought to bear with the same effect on the
whole body of the citizens. If their movements are
more irregular, and liable to greater excesses, they
have their origin in the purer and more noble impulses
of the heart. The natural love of equity, the instinctive
principles of disinterestedness and generosity, originally
implanted in the heart of man by the author of
our being, cannot easily be extinguished in a whole people.
After the tools of faction, and the minions of
power, have exhausted the arts of corruption, these
holier elements of our nature will kindle into spontaneous
enthusiasm, when lofty and generous sentiments
are brought home to the bosom in the accents of a
manly and pathetic eloquence. The great and unsophisticated
springs of human action are always touched
with most effect in large assemblies. In these the prevailing
tone of feeling, when highly exalted, spreads
through the whole by a secret sympathy, with the
rapidity of the electric fluid.</p>

<p>It was before such an audience that eloquence
uttered her voice in ancient times. The orators of
Greece and Rome brought their genius to bear directly
on the popular mind. The public assemblies which
were then held were for actual deliberation. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
not a mockery of consultation on matters upon which
all opinions were definitely made up. They came
together to be instructed, and were open to the seductive
arts of their orators even to a fault. The objects
of deliberation also were of the greatest moment, the
fortunes of a province or a kingdom, the safety of the
republic, the honor, or perhaps the life of the orator
himself or his nearest friends. Every motive which
hope or fear or pride or party could suggest, to animate
the passions, was brought to act on the speaker's mind,
and all depended on a doubtful decision, which was to
be made on the spot, and before the separation of the
assembly. These contests were not of rare occurrence.
They were coming up continually. They
were upon the most magnificent theatre in the world,
and before judges who united a most refined and discriminating
taste with an extraordinary degree of susceptibility
to all the charms of a passionate and harmonious
eloquence. The orators, therefore, were kept in
constant training. Their faculties had no time to cool.</p>

<p>They had no intervals for luxurious repose. The
dignities to which they had risen were watched by
powerful and jealous rivals, always ready to wrest from
them their honors, and they could be retained only by
the same efforts by which they were won.</p>

<p>In these ancient republics eloquence was substantial
and effective power and led to the highest dignities,
which the most aspiring genius could hope to attain.
It was cultivated with an assiduity bearing a just proportion
to the honors with which it was crowned. The
education of the orator commenced in his cradle, and
did not terminate until he had reached the full <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'muturity'">maturity</ins>
of manhood; or, to speak more correctly, it comprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the whole business of his life. All his studies were
made subservient to the art of speaking, and the course
of instruction descended into the most minute details
which could improve him in his action or elocution.
It was this entire devotion to a favorite and honored
art, which raised it to a height of perfection, which it
has never since been able to reach, and which produced
those prodigies in the oratorical art, which have
been the admiration and the despair of succeeding ages.</p>

<p>In the most brilliant period of antiquity there were
two styles of eloquence cultivated by the different orators.
One, calm, subtle and elegant, addressed almost
exclusively to the understanding. In the time of
Cicero this was called the Attic style, and those who
belonged to this school assumed no little credit on the
supposed purity of their Attic taste. The other affected
a style of greater warmth and brilliancy, and intermingled
with the scrupulous dialectics of the former,
frequent appeals to the passions, and adorned their discourses
with all the beauties which could captivate the
imagination. What was then denominated the Attic
style, forms the prevailing characteristic of modern
oratory. It is cool and didactic. It relies almost
wholly on the powers of a cultivated logic and seldom
attempts to reach the understanding through the medium
of the heart. It requires little reflection to determine
which of these styles would bear away the palm
before a popular audience. The former leaves one
half the faculties of the hearer dormant, while the latter
addresses itself to all the powers of man, the moral
as well as the intellectual, instructs the reason while it
agitates the passions, and gives at the same time one
powerful and impetuous movement to the whole man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
But if any one doubts upon this matter let him go to
the pages of Demosthenes and especially to that most
perfect of all his orations, in which he was contending
with his great rival for the glory of a whole life in the
presence of all that was most illustrious in Greece,&mdash;his
oration for the crown. He will find from the beginning
to the end, a clear and exact logic. But it is
logic raised into enthusiasm by the dignity and elevation
of sentiment by which it is surrounded. He will
not find a metaphor or an observation introduced merely
for the purposes of ornament. It is a continued
stream of clear, rapid and convincing argument. But
it is argument enveloped in a torrent of earnestness
and exaggeration, environed with a blaze of anger and
disdain and passion&mdash;it is argument clothed in thunder,
which could no more be listened to with a composed
and tranquil mind than the flashes of lightning could be
viewed with an unblinking eye. Strip Demosthenes of
these accompaniments, of these accessories, if you
please to call them so, and you will leave enough perhaps
to satisfy our modern Attics, but this residue will
be no more like the living Demosthenes who "fulmined
over Greece," than the unformed block of marble
is like the Belvidere Apollo, or a naked skeleton like
a living man.</p>

<p>It is said that the state of manners in modern society
would not bear those bold appeals to the passions which
abound in the ancient orators. We are ingenious in
taking to ourselves credit even for our inferiority, and
it is contended that our understandings are more cultivated
and our passions more under the dominion of
reason. If there be any foundation for this opinion it
must be received with many qualifications. It has become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
a fashion of late to decry the manners and morals
of the republics of antiquity. That their manners
differed in many respects from the modes of fashion
established in what is called good society in modern
times is admitted, but it does not follow that the advantage
is on our side. There is still less foundation for
the opinion that in their intellectual powers the Greeks
and Romans were less cultivated than the most polished
nations of our times. There never existed a nation
in which the intellectual education of the whole body
of the people was carried to so high a pitch as in Athens.
However extravagant the assertion may be
thought, it is indisputably true that the "mob of Athens,"
as the people of that renowned commonwealth
are affectedly called, were of a more refined, severe
and critical taste in every thing that pertains to the beauties
of eloquence than the members of the British House
of Commons have been, at any period of its existence,
from the first meeting of the Wittenagemote to the
present day. They would allow, says Cicero, in their
orators no violation of purity or elegance of language.
<i>Eorum religioni cum serviret orator, nullum verbum
insolens, nullum odiosum ponere audebat.</i> Many a
speech has been cheered by the "<i>hear hims</i>" of the
Treasury Bench in that house, which would have shocked
the discriminating and critical ears, <i>aures teretes ac
religiosas</i>, of that extraordinary people. The whole
testimony of antiquity concurs in proving their extreme
delicacy and fastidiousness in every thing which belongs
to taste in letters and the arts.</p>

<p>There was another peculiarity in the circumstances
of these ancient republics which favored the cultivation
of eloquence. The press, that great engine by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
public opinion is moved in modern times, was then unknown.
Addresses in the assemblies of the people
were not only the ordinary but almost the sole mode
by which public men could influence or enlighten public
opinion. All political discussion assumed this form
and these popular harangues composed a very large
portion of the literature of the times. The language
of oral communication naturally assumes a tone of
greater vivacity and passion than that of the closet.
The predominance of this species of composition must
have had a powerful influence in forming the national
taste and would naturally impart its prevailing tone to
every other species. Such seems to have been the
fact. The philosophers and historians caught something
of the animated and rhetorical manner of their
public speakers, and in that species of eloquence which
is suited to the nature of their subjects, surpass the
moderns nearly as much as their orators do. Plato
stands as far above all rivals in this particular, as his
countryman and disciple Demosthenes. The easy and
graceful movement of his dialogue, the splendid amplification
and harmonious numbers of his declamation
and the warm and animated glow of moral enthusiasm,
which he has thrown over his mystical speculations,
render his works the most perfect specimen of philosophical
eloquence ever yet produced. His example
will also show what importance was attached to style
alone by the teachers of ancient wisdom. The last labors
of a long life, which had been devoted to the most
sublime philosophy of the age, were employed in retouching
and remodelling the inimitable graces of his
rich and flowing periods; <i>musæo contingens cuncta lepore</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>A superiority scarcely less imposing in this respect
will be found in their historians. Their genius was
also kindled by a coal from the altar of the orators. I
am ready to acknowledge the great merit of the classic
historians of modern times. I am not insensible to the
calm and sustained dignity of Roberston, to the melody
of his full and flowing style, though it sometimes fills
the ear without filling the mind. He must be a much
more morose critic who is not delighted with the simple
and unaffected elegance of Hume, and with that admirable
facility with which he intermingles the most profound
reflections in a narration always easy, copious
and graceful. Nor can the historian of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire be forgotten in an enumeration
of those who have done honor to this branch
of literature. After all that has been said and written
against him, he has left a work which the world will
not willingly suffer to die. The Randolphs and Taylors
and Chelsums by whom he was assailed, have
passed into an easy oblivion, but the great work of the
historian will always find a place in every library and
a reader in every well educated man. The pomp and
stateliness of his style sometimes bordering on the turgid
may provoke a sneer from those who look only to
the surface, but he had a mind enriched by various
and extensive learning, which he has exuberantly and
tastefully displayed in every page of his work. It may
also be admitted that in modern times history has in
its general character received something more of a philosophical
tone. But what it has gained on the side of
philosophy it has more than lost on that of eloquence.</p>

<p>Compare the triumvirate of English historians in this
respect with the inestimable remains of antiquity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
there is a disparity as striking as it is difficult to be
accounted for. In this, as in every other department
of literature, the Romans were the imitators of the
Greeks; but in history while they imitated they surpassed
their masters. The two great historians of
Rome stand above all that preceded as well as all that
followed them. The history of the rise of the Roman
republic, from a small band of outlaws to the uncontrolled
mastery of the world, is the most extraordinary
chapter in the history of the human race. The annals
of mankind present nothing that resembles it. A
splendid or an affecting story may be degraded or belittled
by being told in an unworthy style. But the
style of Livy never falls below the dignity of his subject.
His eloquence is as magnificent as the fortunes
of the eternal city. In splendor of language, in glowing
and picturesque description, in warmth and brilliancy
and boldness of coloring, and in the dignified and majestic
movement of his whole narrative, there is nothing
in the literature of any country which will bear a comparison
with the Decads of Livy. He is always on
the borders of oratory and poetry, without ever passing
the soberness of history. <i>Mille habet ornatus, mille
decenter habet.</i></p>

<p>The golden age of letters in Rome was as short as
it was brilliant. It scarcely surpassed in duration the
ordinary term of human life. Commencing with Cicero,
it closed with the generation who were his cotemporaries,
the last who breathed the free air of the
republic. But in the universal corruption of taste and
morals that followed the extinction of liberty, there
arose one man, Tacitus, whose genius belonged to a
happier age. In his own, it has been remarked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
as much truth as beauty, he stands like a column in
the midst of ruins. It has been said that the secret of
his style belongs to the circumstances of his life, as
well as to the peculiar temperament of the man. He
wrote the history of his own times, and they presented
but few bright spots on which the eye could repose
with pleasure. But he paints the features of that dark
and fearful peace, of that awful and portentous silence
of despotism, convulsed as it was by internal dissensions
and agitated by all the vices of a profligate populace
and an abandoned nobility, in words of enchantment.
While they seem to express every thing that is
terrible in tragedy, they suggest to the imagination
more than meets the ear. No man could have described
those scenes as he has done but one who had seen
and felt them. His vivid and graphic pictures speak
at once to the eye, to the imagination, and to the heart;
and without any of the parade or ostentation of eloquence,
he impresses on the mind of the reader all the
feelings which seem to prevail in his own.</p>

<p>The current of fashion has for some time been setting
strongly against classical learning. In an age of
so much intellectual activity as the present, all sorts of
new opinions are received with favor. The most
extravagant have their hour of triumph until they are
chased from the stage by some new absurdity, or until
the restless love of change is drawn off to some more
startling paradox. This insatiable thirst for novelty is
carried into literature as well as other things. But the
principles of good taste are unchangeable. They have
their foundations deeply laid in nature and truth, and
the tide of time which sweeps into oblivion the sickly
illusions of distempered imaginations, passes over these
unhurt. The Bavii and Maevii of former ages, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
like those of later times enjoyed for their hour the
sunshine of fashionable celebrity, have been long ago
gathered to their long home, but the beauties of Homer
and Virgil are as fresh now as they were at the beginning.
Independent of the arguments commonly used
in favor of classical learning, there are two considerations
which recommend these studies to peculiar favor
in this country. I advert to them the more willingly,
because they have not been usually urged in proportion
to their importance.</p>

<p>The first is addressed to our literary ambition. If
there be any department of elegant literature in which
we may hope to surpass our European ancestors and
cotemporaries, it is in eloquence. It is the fairest and
most hopeful field which now remains for literary distinction.
In every other the moderns, if they have not
equalled, are not far behind the ancients. Their poetry
can scarcely claim an advantage over that of the
moderns, except what it owes directly to the superiority
of the ancient languages. But if we except some of
the finest productions of the French pulpit in the reign
of Louis XIV. there is nothing in modern literature
which approaches the eloquence of antiquity. The
most accomplished of our forensic and parliamentary
speakers are at an immeasurable distance from the
perfection of the ancient orators. If there be any
modern nation, which may hope to emulate them with
some prospect of success, it is our own. In our free
institutions and in the free genius of our countrymen
we have all that is necessary. The soil is prepared
and we are already a nation of debaters. But if we
would add to the faculty of fluent speaking the gifts of
eloquence, these must be sought where the ancients
found them, in a patient and persevering devotion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the art. We must be made sensible both of its dignity
and its difficulty, and nothing can so effectually give
us this knowledge as a familiar acquaintance with the
inimitable remains of the orators of Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>The second consideration is of a political character.
The feudal governments of Europe may have an interest
in discouraging a taste for these studies. The literature
of antiquity, in its prevailing tone and character,
is deeply impregnated with the free spirit of the age in
which it was produced. Nothing can be more repugnant
to that temper of patient servility which it is the
policy of such governments to foster. Nothing can
more powerfully invigorate those generous feelings
which are inspired by the consciousness of freedom,
than a familiarity with the historians and orators of
Greece and Rome. There is an uncompromising
spirit of liberty breathing its divine inspirations over
every page, wholly irreconcilable with that courtly
suppleness which is adapted to the genius of these governments.
These proud republicans had no superstitious
veneration for anointed heads. They were accustomed
to behold suppliant royalty trembling in the
antichambers of their Senate, or its haughty spirit still
more humbled in swelling the triumphal pomp of their
generals and consuls. These sights served to nourish
a profound feeling of the dignity, which is attached to
the person of a freeman, a feeling more deeply engraved
on the spirit of antiquity than any other sentiment
of the heart. It seems to have constituted the very
soul of their genius, and it breathes its sacred fires
through every ramification of their literature. So intimately
was it incorporated with the very elements of
their intellectual nature, that nothing could extinguish
it short of those calamities which spread their deadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
mildews over the fires of genius itself. After the constitutional
liberty of the country sunk under the weight
of military despotism, its scattered flames still broke
out at intervals in the few great men who arose to
throw a gleam of brightness over the surrounding
gloom. It shewed itself in the pathetic and affecting
complaints of Tacitus, and burst forth in the bitter and
indignant sarcasms of Juvenal. The venerable father
of song declared in prophetic numbers that the first
day of servitude robbed man of half his virtue, and
Longinus, the last of the ancient race of great men,
holds up the lights of fifteen centuries experience to
verify the words of the poet. It is democracy, says
he, that is the propitious nurse of great talents, and it
is only in democracy that they flourish. Let the minions
of legitimacy then extinguish if they can the emulation
of ancient eloquence; it is their most dangerous
enemy; but let us, who inherit the liberties of the ancient
republics, cherish it with a sacred devotion. It
is at once the child and the champion of freedom.</p>

<h2><a name="RELIGION" id="RELIGION"></a>RELIGION.</h2>

<h3>By Jason Whitman.</h3>


<p>Religion, as introduced to us by our Saviour, attracts
our attention and enlists our affections, not by any
solemn pomp or formal parade, but by her beautiful
and interesting simplicity, her real and intrinsic worth.
Nor has she been introduced to us, merely that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
may dwell in our temples to be gazed at from a distance
and occasionally adored. No. She has been
introduced to us, that we might take her familiarly by
the hand, conduct her into our houses and seat her by
our firesides,&mdash;not as an occasional visitor there, but as
an intimate friend&mdash;perfectly free and unreserved, ever
ready to lend her aid in making home the abode of
happiness, or to go forth with us and assist in elevating
and purifying the pleasures and the intercourse of social
life; ever ready to assist in the various labors of life&mdash;to
guide and cheer the conversation&mdash;to bend over the
bed of sickness, or to mingle her sympathies with those
who are mourning. It is her office to elevate and improve
mankind, not by looking down upon them from
above, but by dwelling familiarly and habitually among
them, restraining, by the respect which her presence
inspires, every thing impure and unholy, until she has
awakened aspirations after the pure, the holy, the spiritual,
the infinite and eternal. Such was the Christian
Religion as introduced to us by our Saviour. Would
that she might ever remain such, an inmate of our
houses, a member of our family circles, whose form
and features are familiar to our children, and for whom
their attachment grows with their growth and strengthens
with their strength. But such have not, it would
seem, been the feelings of mankind in regard to her.
They, filled with admiration, perhaps, for her excellence,
and fearing, lest she might be treated with rude
familiarity, have thought to add to her dignity and to
increase the respect entertained for her, by enveloping
her in the folds of unintelligible mysteries, and by suffering
her to be approached only in a formal manner,
upon the set days when and the appointed places where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
she holds her levees. The consequences of this have
been such as might have been expected. While there
are multitudes of admirers of Religion, as one of a
higher order of beings altogether above and beyond
themselves, there are few who make her the companion
of their daily walk&mdash;few who take her to themselves
and, in the firm conviction that they were made for
each other, leave all things else, cleave unto and become
one with her.</p>

<p>Would that we might all embrace Christianity as she
is in herself&mdash;as she was introduced to us by our Saviour,
in all her simplicity&mdash;in all her purity&mdash;that we
might make her the companion of our lives&mdash;the friend
of our hearts. She is one, who will with readiness
accompany us wherever we go&mdash;pointing out to us the
way of our duty and the sources of our happiness.
Are we children she will teach us the duties of children.
Are we parents she will instruct us in our duties
as parents. In prosperity she will increase our happiness&mdash;in
adversity she will sweeten our cup&mdash;in sickness
she will alleviate our pains, and, when called
away by the stern summons of death, she will accompany
us and introduce us into the society of heaven
with which she is intimate&mdash;the society of our God&mdash;of
Jesus our Saviour&mdash;and of the spirits of the just made
perfect, concerning whom she has often conversed with
us, making us acquainted with their principles, feelings
and characters, and exerting within us a desire to be
with them.</p>

<p>Immediately after the horrid murder of young Darnley,
Mary of Scotland removed from the scene of his
death to Sterling, ostensibly on a visit to her infant son.
Thither she was followed by all the gay members of
her court, among whom were the Earl of Bothwell and
Balfour, the suspected murderers. A short time previous
to this journey Mary had received a letter from
one of her subjects in the north, strenuously recommending
a young and interesting female to her protection,
who, as the letter stated, had especial reasons for
sojourning awhile in the neighborhood of the court.
Mary with her usual benevolence kindly received the
lovely stranger, and was so won by her grace and
melancholy beauty, that with the thoughtlessness of her
impulsive character, she installed her in the royal
household and admitted her to the closest intimacy of
mistress and servant. Her affections daily increased
for one of whom she knew nothing, except that she
was reported to have sprung from a noble but impoverished
family, and had been drawn to court by her interest
in a dear relation, or perhaps lover. The queen
did not trouble herself to inquire into particulars, at a
time when her own affairs not only engrossed her
thoughts, but the attention of all Europe. Certain it
was, that whatever had drawn Ellen Craigh to the Scottish
court, it was no desire to partake of its pleasures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Though she occasionally mingled with the ladies of
Mary's household, and even listened with silent interest
to the scandal which recent events had given rise to, she
sedulously secluded herself from the gallants of the
court, and on no occasion had been known to leave the
immediate apartment of the queen, except for a short
space each day, when the relative who had drawn her
from home might be supposed to occupy her attention.</p>

<p>On the day our story commences, Throgmorton, the
English ambassador, had arrived at Sterling with despatches,
which had been forwarded from London after
the first news of young Darnley's death reached the
court of St. James. Mary, eager to conciliate the imperious
Elizabeth, had ordered an entertainment to be
made in honor of her ambassador, and yielding to his
first request, or rather demand for an audience, had
been more than an hour closetted with him, in the little
oratory which communicated alike with her audience-room
and sleeping chamber.</p>

<p>The hour for robing had long passed, and Ellen
Craigh was alone in the royal bed-chamber, waiting
the appearance of her mistress. She might have been
taken for a sorrowing angel, as she sat in the embrasure
of a window, with the mellow-tinted light streaming
through the stained glass over her tresses of waving
gold, and flooding her small and exquisite figure with
a brilliancy almost too gorgeous to harmonize with the
delicate cheek and sorrowful blue eyes, which, at the
moment, wore an expression of suffering which nothing
on earth can represent, so patient and holy was it.
She continued in one position, listlessly swaying the
cord of twisted gold, which looped back the curtain
falling in magnificent volumes over the upper part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the window, or pulling the threads from a massive
tassel and scattering them one by one at her feet, till
the carpet around looked as if embroidered over and
over with the glittering fragments. The indistinct
voices which came from the oratory, where the queen
and the ambassador were seated, fell unheeded upon
her senses, till a tone was mingled with theirs which
started her to sudden life. She leaped up with an
energy that sent the mutilated tassel with a crash
against the window, and flinging back the tapestry
which concealed the door of the oratory, bent her eye
to a crevice in the ill-fitted pannel. The beating of
her heart was almost audible, and the thin slender hand
which held back the tapestry quivered like a newly
prisoned bird, as she gazed with intense eagerness into
the apartment. The queen sat directly opposite the
door. At her right hand was placed a dark handsome
man, of about thirty, with a haughty and almost fierce
array of countenance, dressed in a style of careless
magnificence, which bespoke a love of display rather
than true elegance in his choice of attire. A subdued
smile lurked about his lips, and he seemed intently
occupied in counting the links of a massive gold
chain, which fell over his doublet of three-piled velvet,
studded and gorgeously wrought with jewels and embroidery.
Now and then he would drop his hand
carelessly over the queen's chair-arm, and fix his black
eyes with a bold and admiring gaze on her features, with
a freedom which bespoke more of audacious love, than
of respect for the royal beauty. She not only submitted
to his free glance, but more than once returned it
with one of those looks which had scattered sorrow
through many a Scottish bosom.</p>

<p>Throgmorton sat little apart. He had been speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
in a strain of calm expostulation; but marking the interchange
of glances between the queen and her haughty
favorite, he became indignant, and addressed Bothwell
with a degree of cutting contempt, which turned
the lurking smile on the nobleman's lip to a curl of
bitter defiance. Heedless of the royal presence, he
stood up, and rudely pushing the council-table from
before him, half drew his sword, as if to punish the
offender upon the spot. Throgmorton endured the
blaze of his large fierce eyes with calm composure,
and deliberately measuring his person from head to
foot with a contemptuous glance, was about to resume
his discourse; but the queen rose from her seat, and
placing her white and jewelled hand persuasively on
Bothwell's arm, she fixed her beautiful eyes full on
his, and uttered a few low words of entreaty; then
turning to the envoy, her exquisite face flushed with anger
and her eyes flashing like diamonds, she exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Leave our presence, sir ambassador, and thank
our moderation that thou art permitted to depart in
safety, after this insult to our most trusty and faithful
follower! Nay, my lord of Bothwell, put thy hand
from that sword-hilt&mdash;this matter rests with us&mdash;doubt
not, thy honor as well as that of thy mistress shall be
duly righted."</p>

<p>The frowning nobleman pushed back his blade with
a clang, and turned moodily away.</p>

<p>The queen looked on him gravely for a moment, and
then turning to the Englishman proceeded with less of
vehemence than had accompanied her last command.</p>

<p>"The message of our loving cousin has given us a
surfeit of advice. To-morrow we will resume the
subject," she said, forcing one of the resistless smiles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
which she could call up at will, to brighten her lips;
and with a graceful wave of the hand, she motioned
him to withdraw.</p>

<p>The envoy bowed low and left the room without
further speech. But the door was scarcely closed,
when, with sudden self-abandonment, the queen threw
herself into her chair, and burst into a passion of tears.
Bothwell, who was angrily pacing the room, approached,
and sinking to one knee took her hand tenderly in his.
She looked at him a moment through her tears, murmured
a few broken words, and dropping her face to
his shoulder, wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Poor Ellen Craigh witnessed the whole scene. She
heard Bothwell's expressions of soothing endearment,
and saw the beautiful head, with its garniture of brown
tresses, fall with such helpless dependence on his shoulder.
A moment, and the queen drew the snowy
hand, sparkling with tears and jewels, from her eyes,
and sat upright. With a choking sensation the poor
girl gazed on that face, in its transcendent loveliness,
till a mist gathered before her eyes, and the words of
Bothwell came broken and confusedly to her ear.
When they left the oratory a few moments after, her
hand fell nerveless to her side, the tapestry swept over
the door with a rustling sound, and staggering a few
paces into the chamber, she fell her whole length upon
the carpet, her golden hair sweeping back from her
bloodless forehead, her pale lips trembling and her
slight limbs as strengthless as an infant's. Thus she
lay for a time, and then tears gushed profusely from
her shut eyes. After which she arose to a sitting
posture, with her feeble hands twisted the scattered
ringlets round her head, and arose; but so pale, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
wo-begone, her very heart seemed crushed forever.
Dragging herself to her favorite seat in the embrasure
of a window, she leaned her temple against the stained
glass, and murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"Enough!&mdash;oh, enough!&mdash;I must go home now."
But while the words of misery trembled on her lips, the
door was flung open, and Mary Stewart entered the
apartment. The room was misty with the purple
glow of sunset, and the queen passed her shrinking
attendant without observing her. Hastily advancing to
a table, she took up a golden bird-call, and blew a peremptory
summons; then throwing herself into a chair
which stood opposite a small table, on which glittered the
splendid paraphernalia of a French toilette, she waited
the appearance of her attendants. Ellen Craigh made a
strong effort and arose.</p>

<p>"Ha, art thou there, my mountain-daisy?" said the
queen, looking kindly upon her,&mdash;"order lights, and
send back the flock of tire-women my silly whistle
has brought trooping hitherward&mdash;no hands but thine
shall robe me to night."</p>

<p>Ellen obeyed, and after a few moments the light
from two large candles of perfumed wax broke over
the little mirror, with its framework of filigree silver,
and flashed upon the golden essence-bottles and scattered
jewels which covered the dressing-table. The
poor waiting-maid drew back from the brilliant glare
with the shudder of a sick heart. The queen looked
on her earnestly for a moment, and then putting the
golden locks back from her temple, as she would have
caressed a child, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;cheeks like new-fallen snow!&mdash;lips trembling
like the aspen!&mdash;and eye-lashes heavy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
tears!&mdash;how is this, child?&mdash;but we bethink us;&mdash;was
it not some untoward affair of the heart which brought
thee to our court? We have been too negligent;&mdash;tell
us thy grief, and on the honor of a queen, if there
be wrong we will have thee bravely righted&mdash;so speak
freely."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!&mdash;not here!&mdash;<i>never to you</i>."</p>

<p>Here poor Ellen broke off and stood before the
queen, her hands clasped, her lips trembling and her
large supplicating eyes fixed imploringly on her face.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the queen soothingly, "at some
other time be it&mdash;but remember that in Mary Stewart
her attendant may find a safe friend as well as an
indulgent mistress," and shaking her magnificent tresses
over her shoulders, the royal beauty composed herself
for the operations of the toilette.</p>

<p>Ellen gathered up the glossy volumes of hair and
commenced her task. Her limbs shook, a cold moisture
crept over her forehead, and her quivering hands
wandered with melancholy listlessness, through the
mass of shining ringlets it was her duty to arrange.
As she stooped forward in her task, one of her own
fair curls fell down and mingled, like a flash of spun
gold, with those of her mistress. As if there had been
contagion in the touch, she flung it back with a smile
of strange, cold bitterness, the first and last that ever
wreathed her pure lips; for hers was a heart to suffer
and endure, but never to hate; it might break, but no
wrong could harden it.</p>

<p>While her toilette was in progress, Mary became
nervous and restless, now pushing the velvet cushions
from her feet, and then moving the lights about the
dressing-table, as if dissatisfied with the arrangement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
every thing about her. At length she fell back in her
chair, buried her face in her hands, and fairly burst
into tears. Ellen grasped the back of her chair, and
bending her pale face to the queen's ear, murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tears are for the deserted&mdash;why does the queen
weep?"</p>

<p>Mary was too deeply engrossed with her own feelings
to mark the exact words, or the tremulous voice
of her attendant. She threw the damp hair back from
her face, and dashing the tears from her eyes exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no! it is nothing&mdash;proceed&mdash;there! let that
ringlet fall thus upon the neck&mdash;now our robe, quickly&mdash;we
shall be waited for at the banquet."</p>

<p>Ellen brought forth the usual mourning robe of black
velvet, laden with bugles; but a flush of anger, or perhaps
of shame, overspread the queen's face, and with
an impatient gesture she exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not that, girl&mdash;not that&mdash;I will mock my heart no
longer!&mdash;away with it, and bring a more seemly garment!&mdash;the
proud Englishman shall not scoff at our
widow's weeds again."</p>

<p>Ellen obeyed, and the queen was soon robed as she
had desired. Few objects could have been more beautiful
than this dangerous woman, when she arose from
her toilette&mdash;the perfect, yet almost voluptuous proportion
of her form betrayed by the snowy robe, her tapering
arms banded with jewels, and her superb waist
bound with a string of immense pearls, clasped in front
by a single diamond, and terminating where the broidery
of her robe commenced, in tassels of threaded
pearls. A tiara of small Scottish thistles, crowded amethysts
and rough emeralds, burned with a purple light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
among her curls, and the face beneath seemed scarcely
human, so radiant was its expression, and so beautiful
the perfect harmony of its features. Throwing a
careless glance at the mirror&mdash;for Mary was too confident
of her attraction to be fastidious&mdash;she took up
her perfumed handkerchief and left the room.</p>

<p>Ellen Craigh gazed after her sovereign till the last
graceful wave of her drapery disappeared; then drawing
a deep breath, as if her heart had thrown off an
oppression quite insupportable, she cast a glance almost
of loathing around the sumptuous apartment, and
entered the oratory. Dropping on her knees by the
chair which Bothwell had occupied, she laid her cheek
on the cushion and wept long and freely, as if the contact
with something <i>he</i> had touched had a softening influence
on her heart. As she arose, the gleam of a
handkerchief lying on the floor attracted her attention.
She snatched it up with a faint cry of joy, for on one
corner she found embroidered an earl's coronet and
the crest of Bothwell. Eagerly thrusting the prize into
her bosom, she left the oratory and passed into the
open street.</p>

<p>It was midnight when Mary Stewart returned to her
chamber. The lights were burning dimly on the table,
and an air of gloomy grandeur filled the apartment.
The queen was evidently much distressed; a
deep glow was burning on her cheek, and her usually
smiling eyes were full of a strange excitement. She
snatched up the little golden call as if to give a summons,
and then flung it down again, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;I could not brook their searching eyes,"
and with a still more disturbed air she paced the chamber,
now and then stopping to divest herself of the ornaments
she had worn at the ambassador's festival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps for the first time in her life the agitated
woman unrobed herself, and flinging back the crimson
drapery which fell in heavy masses from the large
square bedstead, threw herself upon the gorgeous
counterpane and buried herself in the folds, as if they
could shut out the evil thoughts that burned in her
heart; but it was in vain that she strove for rest&mdash;that
she gathered the rich drapery over her head and
pressed her burning cheek to the pillow; her thoughts
were all alive and astray.</p>

<p>It was a mournful sight&mdash;that beautiful and brilliant
woman yielding herself to the thraldom of a wicked
man, and rushing heedlessly to that which was to
throw a stain upon her memory, enduring as history
itself. Sin is hideous in every form&mdash;but when it
darkens the bright and beautiful of earth, like a cloud
over the sun, we reproach it for its own blackness, and
doubly for the brightness it conceals.</p>

<p>As the misguided woman lay, with a hand pressed
over her eyes, and one arm, but half divested of its
jewels, flung out with a kind of desperate carelessness
upon the counterpane, the murmur of an infant voice
reached her from a neighboring apartment. She started
up and tears gathered in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Woe is me!" she exclaimed, "this mad passion
makes me forgetful alike of prayer and child."</p>

<p>Folding a dressing-gown about her, she entered the
room whence the sound had come, and reappeared
with an infant boy pressed to her bosom. After kissing
him again and again with a sort of despairing fondness,
she bore him to a recess where a small lamp of
chased silver burned before a crucifix of the same metal,
and an embroidered hassock was placed as if for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
devotion. Had she been left alone in the holy stillness
of the night, with her lovely babe upon her bosom,
and the touching symbol of our Saviour's death
before her, the evil influence which was hurrying her
on to ruin might have been counterbalanced; but as
she knelt with the smiling babe lying on the hassock,
her eyes fixed on the crucifix, and the guilty glow ebbing
from her cheeks, the door softly opened, and
the Earl of Bothwell stole into the chamber. Mary
sprang to her feet as if to reprove the insolent intruder,
but a sense of modesty, which in all her follies seemed
never to have left her, succeeded to her indignation, if
indeed she felt any. She glanced at her dishabille
with a painful flush, and hastily seating herself, drew
her uncovered feet, which had been hastily thrust into
a pair of furred slippers, under the folds of her dressing
gown, and then requested him to withdraw, in a
voice which betrayed as much of encouragement as
of reproof.</p>

<p>Without even noticing her request, Bothwell lifted
the boy from the hassock, and seating himself, addressed
her in a low and gentle tone, which he knew well
how to assume. The erring woman listened to the
witchery of his voice, till the unnatural glow again <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'died her cheek'">died from
her cheek</ins>, and she sat with her eyes fixed on his, as a
beautiful bird yielding to the fascination of a serpent.</p>

<p>"But thy wife," she said in a low irresolute tone,
when Bothwell pressed for a reply to what he had been
urging, "much as Mary may love&mdash;much as she may
sacrifice, she cannot thrust a young and loving woman
from a heart she loves and puts her faith in."</p>

<p>"Young and loving!" repeated Bothwell, with a
sneer curling his haughty lip, "young and loving!&mdash;truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
your grace must have been strangely misinformed;&mdash;she
who styles herself Countess of Bothwell
nearly doubles the age of her unfortunate husband; and
as for love, if she knows any, it is for the broad acres
which own him as their master."</p>

<p>A scarcely perceptible smile dimpled the queen's
mouth, as she heard this account of her rival, but she
made no reply, and Bothwell resumed his tone of earnest
entreaty. As he proceeded, his voice and manner
became more energetic.</p>

<p>"Say that you consent," he said, "say but a word,
and the breath of evil shall never reach you;&mdash;say but
your hand is mine as a token of assent, and Bothwell
will worship you like a very slave."</p>

<p>The queen raised her hand, and though it trembled
like an aspen, she placed it in his.</p>

<p>"It is thy queen who is the slave," she murmured
in a broken voice, as Bothwell raised the beautiful
hand to his lips, and covered it with rapturous kisses.</p>

<p>As he relinquished her hand, it came in contact with
that of the child. As if an adder had stung her, she
drew it back, and then with a sudden gush of feeling
snatched the boy to her bosom and covered it with tears
and kisses. Bothwell dreaded the influence of the pure
maternal feeling thus expressed. Gently forcing the
young prince from her embrace, he whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Trust him to me, dearest&mdash;trust him to one who
would spill his heart's blood, rather than give pain to
mother or child," and pressing her hand again to his
lips, the arch-hypocrite left the room with the same
cautious tread he had entered it with.</p>

<p>In a few moments after, he placed the young prince
in charge with a creature in his confidence, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"See to it, that none of the Darnley faction get possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of the brat,&mdash;keep him safe, or strangle him at
once."</p>

<p>On the next day the Earl of Bothwell left Sterling,
and it was whispered that he had been banished from
court through the influence of the English ambassador;
but conjecture was lost in astonishment, and when, two
days after, the court at Sterling was broken up, and
the queen, while on her way to Edinburgh, was met
by Bothwell, with a force of eight hundred men, and
conveyed to Dunbar by seeming violence, men stood
aghast at the news; but those who had marked their
queen closely during the few preceding days, concurred
in the belief that she privately sanctioned the disgraceful
outrage.</p>

<p>It was a gloomy and ancient pile&mdash;that in which
Bothwell had left his deserted wife. In one of its
apartments, beside a huge fire-place, in which a few
embers smouldered in a sea of ashes, sat an old and
wrinkled woman, spreading her withered palms for
warmth, and occasionally turning a wistful look to the
narrow windows, against which the rain and sleet were
beating with real violence. As she listened, the tramp
of approaching horses was heard in the court below,
and before she had time to reach the door, it was flung
open, and the Countess of Bothwell, dripping with wet
and tottering with fatigue, flung herself into the arms
of her old nurse.</p>

<p>"Sorrow on me," exclaimed the good woman, striving
to speak cheerful, "how the child clings to my
neck!&mdash;look up, lady-bird, and do not sob so&mdash;I know
but too well how thy journey has speeded&mdash;may the
curses of an old woman rest&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mabel, Mabel, do not curse him&mdash;do not&mdash;we
cannot love as we will," exclaimed the poor countess,
clinging to the bosom of the old woman, as if to bribe
her from finishing the anathema.</p>

<p>"Hush, darling, hush," replied old Mabel, pressing
her withered lips fondly to the pure forehead of her
foster-child&mdash;"he who could help loving thee&mdash;&mdash;but
hist, what is all this tramping in the court?&mdash;sit down,
and I will soon learn."</p>

<p>The old woman divested the trembling young creature
of her wet cloak and proceeded to the hall. After
a few minutes absence she returned dreadfully agitated;
her sunken eyes glowed like live coals, and her
bony fingers were clenched together as a bird clutches
her prey.</p>

<p>"My own darling," she said in a voice which she
vainly strove to render steady, "I had thought not to
have given his cruel message, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak on," said the poor young creature, raising
her large eyes with the expression of a scared antelope,
"I can bear any thing now."</p>

<p>But she broke off with a sudden and joyful cry, for
the door had been cautiously opened, and her long
absent husband stood before her. Forgetful of his
estrangement&mdash;of his unkindness&mdash;of every thing but
his early love&mdash;she sprang eagerly to his bosom and
kissed him again and again, with the abandonment of
a joyful child. It must have been a heart of stone
which could have resisted such unbounded tenderness.
For one moment, and but for one, she was pressed to
her husband's heart, and then he put her coldly away.</p>

<p>"How is it that I find your lady here, after my
express command to the contrary?" he said, sternly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
addressing the old nurse, while he forced the clinging
arms of the countess from his neck.</p>

<p>The poor young creature shrunk from his look, like
a flower touched by a sudden frost. Mabel threw her
arm around her, and forced her to confront her angry
husband.</p>

<p>"Why is she here!" shouted the old woman fiercely,
"why is she here, in her own home!&mdash;because I
could not, would not kill her with her base lord's message!&mdash;What!
break her heart, and then thrust her
forth to die?&mdash;Villain!&mdash;double-dyed and cowardly
villain!&mdash;may the curses of a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before the old woman could finish her anathema,
the enraged Earl had stricken her grey head to the
floor. The frightened countess fell on her knees beside
her; but, with a terrible imprecation, Bothwell commanded
his attendants to bear his victim from the room,
and sternly ordered his trembling wife to remain.</p>

<p>"As you are here," he said, "it is not essential that
we meet again; your signature is necessary to this
paper; please to affix it without useless delay."</p>

<p>The countess took the paper, which was a petition
to the Commissariot-Court for a divorce from her husband.
Before she had read the first line, every drop
of blood ebbed from her face. She did not faint, but
with a degree of energy foreign to her character,
she grasped the paper in her hands, as if about to tear
it. The Earl seized her wrist, and fiercely demanded
her signature.</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;<i>never</i>!" exclaimed the poor wife, struggling
in his grasp&mdash;"Oh, Bothwell, you cannot wish
it&mdash;you that so loved me&mdash;you that promised to love
me forever and ever&mdash;no, no! you do not mean it&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
cannot put your poor wife away thus!&mdash;I know
that the little beauty you once prized is gone, but tears
and sorrow have dimmed it;&mdash;bear with me but a little
longer&mdash;say that you love me yet, and my bloom will
come again;&mdash;look at me, Bothwell, husband, <i>dear</i>
husband! and say that you did not mean it&mdash;that you
gave me that horrid paper to frighten me&mdash;say but
that, and your poor Ellen will worship you forever!"</p>

<p>This energetic appeal had its effect, even in the hard
hearted Earl. He endured, and even partially returned
the passionate caress with which she had accompanied
her words; and when she fell back exhausted
in his arms, he bore her to a seat and placed himself
beside her.</p>

<p>"Ellen," he said, "I will deal candidly with you&mdash;I
<i>do</i> love you, and have, even while in pursuit of another;
but you have yet to learn that there is a stronger
passion than love&mdash;<i>ambition</i>!"</p>

<p>"You do love me&mdash;bless you, bless you! Bothwell,
for saying so much," she eagerly exclaimed, the affectionate
young creature snatching his hand between both
hers, and covering it with joyful kisses.</p>

<p>But her joy was of short duration. As the serpent
uncoils its glittering folds, so did Bothwell lay bare the
depravity and ambition of his heart. Artifice, persuasion
and threats were used, and at length he prevailed.
The petition for a divorce was signed; but the heart of
the poor countess was broken by the effort.</p>

<p>It is almost useless to tell the reader, that the queen
of Scots had consented to accompany Bothwell to his
castle, but with the appearance of compulsion, on the
night of his intrusion into her chamber. It was to prepare
for the disgraceful visit, that he had sent orders
for the expulsion of his unfortunate wife&mdash;orders which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
old Mabel had never delivered; and now that he had
gained his object, in obtaining her signature to the petition,
he proceeded to give directions for the castle to
be put in order, for the reception of the royal guest.
These arrangements occupied him during most of the
night. At length, weary with exertion, he fell asleep
in his chair. It was morning when he awoke. The
light came softly through a neighboring window, and
there, at his feet, with her head resting on his knees,
and her thin, pale face turned toward him, lay his wife,
asleep. Rest had quieted his ambitious thoughts. He
was alone, in the stillness of a new day, with the gentle
victim of his aspiring passions lying at his feet,
grieved and heart-broken, her eyelids heavy with weeping,
and every limb betraying the sorrow which preyed
upon her. For a moment his heart relented, and a hot
tear fell among her golden curls. Gently, as a mother
would remove a sleeping infant, he raised her head,
laid it on the cushion of his chair, and left her to her
loneliness.</p>

<p>On the next day the Countess of Bothwell left the
castle with her nurse, and not three hours after, Mary
Stewart entered it in company with its wicked lord.</p>

<p>On the fourth day of Mary's sojourn at Dunbar, she,
with the ladies of her train, joined in a stag hunt, which
the Earl had ordered for their entertainment. The
excitement of the chase had drawn Bothwell, for a
moment, from her bridal rein, when an old woman
came from a neighboring hut, and in a few ungracious
words, invited the queen to rest a while. Mary gracefully
accepted the offered courtesy, and some of her
attendants would have followed her to the hut; but the
old woman motioned them back with a haughty wave
of her hand, and conducted the queen alone. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
was no vestige of furniture in the room, except two
small stools and a narrow bed, on which the outlines
of a human form were visible. Grasping the queen's
hand firmly in her own, the old woman drew her to the
bed, and throwing back a sheet, pointed with her long
fleshless finger to the form of a shrouded female.</p>

<p>"Look!" she sternly exclaimed, fixing her keen eyes
on the face of the queen.</p>

<p>Mary looked with painful interest on the thin face,
as white and cold as alabaster, with the golden hair
parted from the pure forehead, and a holy quiet settled
on every beautiful feature. White roses were scattered
over the pillow, and the repose of the dead was
heavenly. Mary bent over the corpse, and her tears
fell fast and thick among the fresh flowers.</p>

<p>"Alas, my poor Ellen!" she said, turning to the
woman, who stood like a statue pointing sternly to the
body, "of what did she die?"</p>

<p>"Of a broken heart!" replied the nurse coldly, and
with the same icy composure which had marked her
conduct, she led her royal visitor to the door, without
speaking another word.</p>

<p>Had she explained that Ellen Craigh and the Countess
of Bothwell were the same person, regret for the
evil she had wrought might have checked Mary in her
career of folly. But the death of the deserted wife
was kept a secret among the few faithful followers who
had accompanied her in her wild expedition to Mary's
court, and the nurse, on whose bosom she had yielded
up her life. While the courts of Scotland were agitated
with the divorce of Bothwell, the haughty man
little knew that his gentle wife had ceased to feel his
cruelty.</p>

standardized. This required the addition of quotation marks in several
places. Where the non-use of quotation marks was consistent within a
story, no changes were made.</p>

Estimate of Our Own Country," in "The Americans at home; or Byeways,
backwoods, and prairies, ed. by the author of 'Sam Slick'," London:

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
